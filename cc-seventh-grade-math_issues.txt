Failing items for nice_x6b17ba59 (count=43):
- nice_x59cb24614d11221e_12911 -> The numeric scale in the SVG (4 units = 5 cm) matches the textual/MathML description and the feedback calculation (12 units in the drawing -> 3 × 5 = 15 cm). However, there is a content mismatch between the visual and some textual elements: the SVG clearly depicts an orange emoji, and the stem text asks about an orange, but the <img> alt text describes a drinking glass emoji, and the item title references a glass. This creates a contradiction between the diagram and parts of the item’s textual description, even though the scale and resulting answer are numerically consistent.
- nice_xb561b39c92ce571f_67616 -> The item prompt asks: "Select the point in Figure 2 that corresponds to point T in Figure 1," and the response options are A–D with the correct answer set to A. However, the provided SVG diagram shows only two unlabeled pentagons labeled "Figure 1" and "Figure 2" and contains no point markers or labels such as T on Figure 1 or A/B/C/D on Figure 2. Thus, the critical visual information referenced by the text is missing from the diagram, making it impossible to match a corresponding point or justify the correct response. While the polygons’ coordinates indicate that Figure 2 is indeed a scaled (1.5x) version of Figure 1 (consistent with the statement "Figure 2 is a scaled version of Figure 1"), the absence of labeled points creates a clear inconsistency between the diagram and the question/choices.
- nice_x11930bcfb3eecae4_36499 -> The item text and feedback assert that the two marked angles are complementary (sum to 90°) with one marked as 42°, hence x = 48°. The SVG indeed shows a right-angle marker at point B between BA (vertical up) and BC (horizontal right), and two arc labels: “42°” between BA and a slanted ray BD, and “x” between BD and BC. However, the actual geometry of the drawn slanted ray BD (B at (200,200) to D at (300,120)) creates angles that do not match 42° and 48°: • The angle between BA (up) and BD is approximately 51.3° (vector BD = (100, -80): cosθ = 80/√(100²+80²) ≈ 0.6247 ⇒ θ ≈ 51.3°). • Consequently, the angle between BD and BC (right) is about 38.7° (90° − 51.3°), not 48°. The arcs in the SVG confirm these rays: the first arc starts on BA (M 200 150) and ends on the BD direction (239.0434,168.7652 lies on line B→D), labeled “42°”; the second arc runs from near BD to the rightward ray and is labeled “x”. Thus, visually measured angles (≈51.3° and ≈38.7°) contradict the textual/feedback values (42° and 48°). Therefore the diagram is not consistent with the stated numbers and the correct response of 48.
- nice_xbcb1e2f9e599028d_98672 -> Parsed item: The prompt asks to find x from the figure. The diagram shows a straight line A–B–C with a ray BD above the line. Two adjacent angles at B are labeled: the left angle (between BA and BD) labeled “3x” and the right angle (between BD and BC) labeled “75°”. The feedback explicitly uses the linear pair relationship and forms the equation 3x + 75° = 180°, yielding x = 35. Diagram analysis: The SVG explicitly draws coordinates for the segments and arcs. B is at (210,160), C at (360,160), and D at (270,70). Thus BD has vector (60, -90), i.e., an angle of about 56.31° above the positive x-axis (since y is downward in SVG). The orange arc (75° label) is drawn from near the BD direction to the rightward horizontal; its path endpoints confirm an angular sweep of roughly 56.3°, not 75°. Correspondingly, the blue arc (3x label) spans the complementary angle of roughly 123.7° (180 - 56.3). Therefore, the drawn geometry suggests angle DBC ≈ 56.3°, which would imply 3x ≈ 123.7° and x ≈ 41.2°, not x = 35. Consistency check: While the textual math (3x + 75 = 180 → x = 35) is internally consistent and matches the numeric labels in the figure, the actual geometry encoded in the SVG (ray BD orientation and arc extents) does not match the labeled 75°. There is no indication that the diagram is not to scale. Hence, there is a visual-text inconsistency between the SVG geometry and the numeric value used in the problem/solution. Conclusion: The item is inconsistent because the right-hand angle drawn is ~56° rather than the labeled 75°, which also alters the implied solution for x if interpreted from the drawing.
- nice_xd26985a79594db70_86074 -> The item asks whether x is greater than, less than, or equal to 128°, and the correct/feedback logic asserts x = 128° because the two highlighted angles are vertical angles. In the SVG, two lines intersect forming an X from (80,80)–(320,320) and (320,80)–(80,320). These are perpendicular (slopes ±1), so all four angles at O are right angles. The two highlighted angle arcs are explicitly drawn as 90° arcs: one path from (236.77,163.23) to (236.77,236.77) and the opposite from (163.23,163.23) to (163.23,236.77), each spanning a quarter circle (90°). Despite this, the diagram text labels one region as “128°” and the opposite as “x”. Thus the visual geometry (90°) contradicts the stated angle measure (128°). Without any “not to scale” disclaimer, the figure implies right angles, which conflicts with the prompt and feedback using 128°. This inconsistency affects the single interaction that depends on the diagram’s information.
- nice_xb25e6358788dc517_12919 -> The item stem explicitly references the women’s 200-meter freestyle (MathML: 200). However, the SVG dot plots are scaled from 52 to 54 seconds and the plotted data cluster around ~52–54 seconds—times that are appropriate for 100 m freestyle, not 200 m (which would be roughly 110–120 seconds). This creates a clear mismatch between the stated event distance and the numerical scale shown in the diagrams. While the dot plots themselves support the keyed answer (“None of the above,” since finals appear faster on average and more variable than semifinals), the fundamental inconsistency between the event described in the text and the time scale in the graphic remains. Additionally, within the SVG, several circle x-positions do not precisely align with the commented numeric values (e.g., a circle at x=350 maps to ~53.35 s, yet the comment lists 53.5), though these comments are not learner-visible. The primary inconsistency is the 200 m event vs 52–54 s axis range.
- nice_x9a1ca40b2e4b5a8f_69801 -> Parsed item: The prompt asks for the relationship between ∠m and ∠n. The scoring key marks choice A (A pair of vertical angles) as correct. The feedback text (both CORRECT and INCORRECT blocks) states that the angles form a linear pair and are supplementary, summing to 180°. Diagram analysis: The SVG shows two lines intersecting at approximately (170,150): a horizontal line (y=150) and a diagonal line from (200,60) to (110,330). The angle arcs indicate ∠m in the upper-right small (acute) region (between the rightward horizontal ray and the up-right diagonal ray) and ∠n in the lower-left small (acute) region (between the leftward horizontal ray and the down-left diagonal ray). These two angles are opposite each other at the intersection, hence they are vertical angles (congruent acute angles), not a linear pair. A linear pair would be adjacent angles sharing a common side whose other sides form a straight line; m and n do not share a side and do not sum to 180°. Therefore, while the diagram supports choice A (vertical angles), the feedback text asserting a linear pair and 180° sum contradicts the diagram and the key. This makes the item internally inconsistent between diagram and feedback text/MathML (180°).
- nice_xa57b0c3a45753d51_61267 -> The item text and feedback use the triangular prism volume formula V = (1/2) b h l with numerical substitution V = 0.375, b = 1 m, h = 0.5 m, yielding 0.375 = 0.25 l ⇒ l = 1.5 m. However, the SVG labels the triangular cross-section dimensions as height = 0.5 m (vertical) and base = 1.5 m (the horizontal front edge). Thus the diagram indicates b = 1.5 m, not 1 m. If the diagram’s dimensions were used with V = 0.375 m³, then 0.375 = (1/2)(1.5)(0.5) l = 0.375 l, giving l = 1 m, which contradicts the expected answer l = 1.5 m. Additionally, the diagram labels 1.5 m on the triangle’s base rather than on the prism length, while the problem asks for the wedge length. Therefore, the diagram’s dimensions are inconsistent with the text and feedback calculations.
- nice_x7a1aff151bb13cf8_71539 -> The SVG diagram is consistent with the textual prompt about dimensions: it shows an 8 m by 5 m patio and a 1 m wide extension on three sides (left, right, and bottom), matching the MathML/text. From the diagram and text, the extension area is (outer 10 m by 6 m) − (inner 8 m by 5 m) = 60 − 40 = 20 m². With 0.5 m × 0.5 m tiles (0.25 m² each), the number of tiles needed is 20 ÷ 0.25 = 80. At 20 tiles per package, required packages = 80 ÷ 20 = 4, with no rounding needed. The response-declaration correctly sets the answer to 4. However, the CORRECT feedback text says, “Correct! Diego needs 5 packages,” which contradicts the diagram- and text-based calculation and the declared correct response. Therefore, the item contains an internal inconsistency (diagram/text vs. feedback).
- nice_xbebcec0e09ee3d84_74813 -> The item text and feedback describe a straight-line supplementary-angles problem with one angle explicitly 110° and the other labeled x, leading to x = 180° − 110° = 70°. However, the SVG shows a parallelogram with a dashed vertical altitude and a right-angle marker at the base; there is no straight line with adjacent angles, no 110° label anywhere, and two separate “x” text labels placed near the left and right sides of the shape. The diagram’s geometry (parallelogram/altitude/right-angle) does not correspond to the described scenario of adjacent supplementary angles on a line. Thus the visual information contradicts the textual/mathematical description and the feedback calculation.
- nice_xd8998a9947394b3a_62437 -> The item text states there are two figures (Figure A and Figure B) with a scale factor of 0.75 mapping A to B, and the feedback formula reinforces that corresponding lengths satisfy length on B = 0.75 × length on A. The correct answer 7.5 implies a correspondence x = 0.75 × 10. However, the SVG shows only a single trapezoid with the bottom base labeled 10 and the top base labeled x. There is no second figure, nor any labels identifying Figure A and Figure B, so the diagram does not depict two corresponding lengths across scaled figures. Moreover, the visual lengths in the single trapezoid (top base ≈ 253.33 px, bottom base ≈ 380 px; ratio ≈ 0.667) do not reflect the stated 0.75 relationship if these were intended as corresponding sides. Thus the visual does not consistently represent the textual scenario of two scaled figures, creating a mismatch between the diagram and the item’s narrative and solution logic.
- nice_x9d0637b3f5e3152e_83263 -> The item stem and feedback describe two dot plots comparing 40-yard dash times for Seahawks vs Jets, and the feedback concludes that the Seahawks’ distribution is centered lower (faster) and is more spread out than the Jets’. However, the decoded SVG shows only a single dot plot: one horizontal axis labeled 40-yard dash time (seconds) with ticks from about 4.2 to 4.8, and a single set of blue dots stacked at y positions near 284/274/264/254. There is no second plot, no team labels, and no separate baseline to represent the second team. Therefore, the visual does not support the comparative statements in the prompt or feedback, and the designated correct answer (C: None of the above) and its rationale cannot be validated against the provided diagram. While the numerical scale (4.2–4.8 seconds) is plausible for 40-yard dash times, the essential comparison between two teams is missing in the SVG, creating a contradiction between the visual and the text/feedback.
- nice_xd71c42100bcc7400_19932 -> The item text asks for the diagram that represents 3/4 + (-1/4) and the feedback explains starting at 0, moving +3/4, then -1/4 to land at 1/2. Choice A’s SVG correctly shows an arrow from 0 to 3/4 labeled +3/4, then a leftward arrow from 3/4 to 2/4 labeled -1/4, ending at the 2/4 tick (which equals 1/2). Choices B and C depict different second steps (+1/4 to 1, and -3/4 back to 0), appropriately serving as distractors. However, all three SVG number lines have incorrect tick labels on the negative side: the ticks between -1 and 0 are labeled “-1 1/4”, “-1 2/4”, and “-1 3/4” even though, by position, they correspond to -3/4, -2/4, and -1/4. This mismatches the actual scale of the diagram and standard fractional values, creating an internal inconsistency in the visual data. Despite the correct modeling of the target expression in option A, the erroneous negative-side labels make the diagrams inconsistent with correct numerical labeling.
- nice_xc01055b565bf3c6a_36230 -> The SVG shows two congruent-shaped quadrilaterals where the dashed figure is an exact dilation of the solid figure by a factor of 1/2 about the origin (0,0). This is evident from the coordinates: the solid figure’s vertices are at (-12, 8), (12, 8), (6, -6), (-9, -6), and the dashed figure’s vertices are exactly half of those: (-6, 4), (6, 4), (3, -3), (-4.5, -3). Thus, the diagram supports the correct answer "Yes" and a scale factor of 1/2. However, the CORRECT feedback text claims specific side-length pairs 30→15, 24→12, 16→8, and 14→7. These numbers do not match the diagram’s actual side lengths: the top base is 24 (halves to 12), the bottom base is 15 (would halve to 7.5, not 7), and the slanted sides are not 30 or 16; moreover, 14 represents the trapezoid’s height, not a side length. Therefore, while the overall scale-factor claim is consistent, the detailed numerical examples in the feedback contradict the figure’s dimensions, creating an inconsistency between diagram and text/MathML.
- nice_x000463496ba0a6a3_46570 -> The stem and answer choices require comparing two groups (Olympic final vs U.S. qualifying meet) and explicitly state “box plots” plural for the top 11 and top 12 throwers. However, the provided SVG shows only a single box-and-whisker plot: one box (rect at x≈231.2 with whiskers at x≈164.3 and x=372, and a single median line at x≈271.68) plotted along a single horizontal axis labeled Distance (m) from 70 to 95. There is no second box plot, no group labels, and no way to compare medians or variability between two datasets. The feedback and keyed correct option (A: “The Olympic final had a higher typical distance”) depend on a comparison that cannot be made from the single box plot shown. Therefore, the visual information is inconsistent with the textual description and the assessment logic.
- nice_x067ecc37fab18853_39187 -> The item asks for x using a straight-angle relationship and the feedback uses 3x + 80° + 2x = 180° ⇒ x = 20. The SVG shows a straight line A–B–C with two rays from B to E and D splitting the upper semicircle into three adjacent angles labeled 3x (left), 80° (center), and 2x (right), which matches the algebraic setup textually. However, the actual coordinates of the rays in the SVG make BE and BD symmetric: BE = (-80,-80) and BD = (80,-80) from B(200,175), which are perpendicular (dot product 0). This implies the central angle ∠EBD is 90°, not 80° as labeled and used in the solution. Thus the diagram’s geometry contradicts the stated 80°, and if taken literally would lead to 3x + 90° + 2x = 180° ⇒ x = 18, not 20. Therefore the visual information is inconsistent with the textual/math information.
- nice_xacabf733053a5e70_55699 -> The two SVG histograms show 7 equal-width bins representing 50 m ranges: 240–290, 290–340, 340–390, 390–440, 440–490, 490–540, and 540–590. Counts read from the bars are: China: [1,2,5,3,4,2,0]; United States: [1,1,2,1,1,1,1]. These visuals support conclusion A (the US has a nonzero count in 540–590 while China has 0) and conclusion B (taller than 390 m totals are China 3+4+2+0=9 vs US 1+1+1+1=4, so China has more). However, the feedback text and MathML are internally inconsistent with the diagrams when describing the calculation for buildings taller than 390 m. The correct feedback states, “Across the bins above 390 m, China’s total is 3+4+2=9, while the United States has 1+1+1=3,” and the incorrect feedback similarly instructs adding only the 390–440, 440–490, and 490–540 ranges. Both omit the 540–590 bin, which is also above 390 m and contains 1 US building according to the diagram. Thus, the feedback undercounts the US total above 390 m (should be 4, not 3), creating a mismatch between the diagrams and the textual/MathML explanation, even though the overall conclusions A and B remain true.
- nice_xe8d6ace4a964daef_50206 -> The prompt asks students to identify, in Figure 2, the point (A–E) that corresponds to point K in Figure 1, and the correct response is set to C. The feedback also states that point C in Figure 2 corresponds to point K in Figure 1. However, the SVG shows two unlabeled pentagons with only the captions “Figure 1” and “Figure 2.” There are no point labels A, B, C, D, E on Figure 2 and no point K on Figure 1, nor any markers indicating which vertices correspond. Thus the visual does not provide the labeled points referenced by the text and feedback, making the item’s diagram inconsistent with the task. Note: the two polygons themselves are consistent with the statement that Figure 2 is a scaled version of Figure 1 (the coordinates show a uniform 1.5× scale), but the missing point labels render the core identification task unsupported by the diagram.
- nice_x4139736ff42aefd2_71626 -> Parsing the item: The prompt asks which shape the intersection of a vertical plane with the figure looks like. The main SVG (SVG 1) depicts a rectangular prism/cube with a shaded vertical slicing plane parallel to a side face. The feedback explicitly states: "A vertical slice parallel to a square face of a cube produces a square cross-section." Thus, the intended correct shape is a square. The answer choices provide: A (square), B (circle), C (rectangle), D (triangle). However, the response declaration marks C as correct. This contradicts the feedback and the geometric situation (a plane parallel to a square face of a cube yields a square cross-section). While the drawn slice in SVG 1 appears rectangular due to perspective, its true shape should be square if the solid is a cube as stated in the feedback. Therefore, the item is inconsistent: the keyed correct choice (C) conflicts with both the feedback and the intended geometry; choice A (square) aligns with the feedback and scenario.
- nice_xdd4b33471181ec59_28486 -> The item asks for the equation to find x from a vertical-angles diagram. The choices and feedback indicate that the two labeled angles are vertical and therefore congruent, leading to (7x+2) = 128 (choice A), and the feedback explicitly states this. The SVG does label the top angle as 128° and the bottom angle as (7x+2)°, consistent with the text and feedback numerically. However, the actual geometry drawn in the SVG shows two lines with slopes 1 and -1 intersecting, i.e., perpendicular lines, forming four right angles (90°). The two arcs drawn at the top and bottom are quarter-circle arcs bounded by the rays, visually indicating 90° angles, not 128°. Thus, the visual geometry (perpendicular lines and 90° arcs) contradicts the labeled angle measure of 128°. If the diagram’s geometry were taken at face value, the appropriate equation would be (7x+2) = 90 (choice D), not choice A. Therefore, the visual information in the SVG is inconsistent with the textual/math information and the declared correct response.
- nice_x6367f5b96d5f9c82_46954 -> The item asks for x and asserts via feedback that x = 118° because vertical angles are congruent. In the SVG, the four rays from O go to A(80,120), C(320,280), D(120,320), and E(280,80). Segments AO–OC are colinear (slope 2/3) and DE are colinear (slope −3/2). The slopes are negative reciprocals, so the two lines are perpendicular; the angle between them is 90°. The drawn arcs around O also span 90° (their endpoints are related by a 90° rotation), indicating right angles. However, the diagram labels the bottom angle as 118° and the top as x, implying x = 118° by vertical angles. This contradicts the actual geometry of the drawn lines, which would make all four angles 90°, not 118°. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the text, the numeric label, and the provided correct answer.
- nice_x5be807a0bb804147_49528 -> The item text states the tent has the dimensions shown below and asks for the height given a volume of 4.5 m^3. The feedback solution uses the triangular prism formula V = 1/2 b h l with substitutions b = 1.5 m and l = 3 m to get h = 2 m. In the SVG, only a single dimension label appears: “3 m,” positioned along the prism’s long direction, which is consistent with l = 3 m. However, the SVG does not display any label for the triangular base length b = 1.5 m used in the calculation. Thus, the calculation relies on a dimension (1.5 m) that is not shown in the diagram, contradicting the claim that the necessary dimensions are shown. There is no numeric contradiction for the 3 m label, but the visual information is incomplete relative to the textual/mathematical information used, making the item inconsistent.
- nice_x72bb801397b54d5e_70834 -> The item asks for the shape of the cross‑section from a horizontal slice of a right square pyramid and specifies (in feedback) that such a slice is parallel to the base and therefore a smaller square. The choice graphics are consistent with this (A is a square; others are triangle/pentagon/hexagon). However, the main diagram (SVG 1) is inconsistent with the stated geometry: the highlighted cross‑section polygon is drawn larger than the base and even slightly above the apex. Specifically, the base’s left/right x-extents are approximately 112.496 and 307.504, while the cross‑section polygon’s left/right x-extents are ~92.995 and ~327.005—exceeding the base on both sides, which is impossible for a horizontal slice inside a pyramid. Moreover, the polygon’s top vertex is at y≈64.273 while the apex is at y≈68.406, placing part of the slice above the apex, which cannot occur if it is the intersection of a horizontal plane with the pyramid. This contradicts the feedback claim that the cross‑section is a smaller square and the general description of a horizontal slice through the pyramid. The note “Diagram not to scale” does not resolve these topological inconsistencies.
- nice_x5703a1475fd4e510_70363 -> The item states the shed measures 6 m by 9 m and the feedback specifies a map scale of 2 units = 1 m, implying the correct rectangle on the map should be 12 units by 18 units, which has a 3:2 aspect ratio (or 2:3 if oriented vertically). The response-declaration marks choice A as correct. Analyzing the SVGs: Choice A is an axis-aligned rectangle from (20,55) to (300,265), dimensions 280 by 210, which is a 4:3 aspect ratio—this does not match the required 3:2 ratio. Choice B is a square (1:1), and Choice C is a pentagon. Therefore, none of the provided diagrams matches the 6 m by 9 m (or 12 by 18 units) proportion, and the marked correct answer (A) contradicts the textual/feedback requirements. Additionally, the title/prompt suggests selecting a rectangle to represent the shed, but two choices (A and B) are rectangles, adding to ambiguity; however, the primary inconsistency is the incorrect aspect ratio of the marked correct choice.
- nice_x0cc9b5263c86adfd_38603 -> The SVG shows point O at (144,126) with rays to A (left), C (right), and B (up-left). The labeled 125° angle lies between OC (rightward) and OB (up-left). The angle labeled x° lies between OA (leftward) and OB (up-left). Geometrically, the smaller angle between OA and OB is acute (about 55°), while the smaller angle between OC and OB is 125°. Therefore, the diagram indicates x < 125°, which matches the keyed correct choice B. However, the CORRECT feedback text states: “Angle x is larger than the 125° angle, therefore x > 125°,” which contradicts both the diagram and the response key. Thus, the visual information is inconsistent with the textual feedback within the XML.
- nice_x209d34a33212eb67_41071 -> The stem shows a triangular cross-section (SVG 1) and asks which solid could produce this cross-section when cut by a horizontal plane. The choices depict: A = triangular prism (SVG 2), B = rectangular prism (SVG 3), C = triangular pyramid (SVG 4), D = cylinder (SVG 5). A horizontal slice of both a triangular prism and a triangular pyramid can produce a triangular cross-section. Thus, based on the visuals and the stem, both A and C are plausible. However, the item is keyed only to A and the feedback explicitly justifies only the triangular prism, creating an inconsistency between the keyed answer/feedback and what the diagrams allow. There are no numerical or MathML inconsistencies, but the visual content (option C) contradicts the single-correct answer declared in the XML.
- nice_x52b855fcdd40c187_74360 -> The item asks for x using the diagram and declares the correct response as 110, with feedback stating that vertical angles are equal so x = 110°. In the SVG, two straight lines intersect at O: a horizontal line from A(80,200) through O(200,200) to C(320,200), and a diagonal line from D(80,320) through O to B(320,80). The diagonal has slope -1 (−45° from the positive x-axis), so the angles formed with the horizontal are 45° (acute) and 135° (obtuse). The upper-left and lower-right angles (the vertical pair labeled 110° and x, respectively) are therefore 135° by the actual geometry of the drawn lines. Additionally, the arc path coordinates themselves span a 135° sweep (e.g., from (146,200) to (238.18,161.82) with sweep flag 1), reinforcing that the depicted angle measure is 135°, not 110°. Thus, the diagram’s geometry contradicts the stated 110° value and the conclusion x = 110°, creating an inconsistency between the SVG and the item text/feedback.
- nice_x5fba55199de6486c_47307 -> The item asks for x using complementary angles and declares the correct answer x = 60°, based on a 90° right angle split into 30° and x. The SVG shows OA (to the right) and OB (up) forming a right angle at O, a blue arc labeled “30°” between OA and OC, and a red arc labeled “x” between OC and OB. However, the actual geometry drawn for OC does not match 30°: the line from O(200,240) to C(300,150) has direction vector (100,−90), which corresponds to an angle of arctan(90/100) ≈ 42° from OA. The blue arc path endpoints likewise indicate an arc of about 42°, not 30°. Consequently, the complementary angle from OC to OB is about 48°, not 60°. Thus, the diagram’s geometry (angles implied by line positions and arcs) contradicts both the “30°” label and the feedback/answer x = 60°, making the visual information inconsistent with the stated solution.
- nice_xaaf221c1e7ea291e_91649 -> Parsed item: The prompt states, "The diagram below shows an upside-down pyramid with a square base" and then asks, "When a horizontal plane cuts the pyramid, what shape is the cross-section?" Correct answer is set to A (square), and feedback explains that a horizontal cross-section of a square-based pyramid is a square. SVG analysis: The main diagram (SVG 1) depicts a pyramid with apex at y≈68 and the base centered around y≈235–292, meaning the apex is above the base (a standard, right-side-up pyramid in screen coordinates), contradicting the text’s description of an "upside-down" pyramid. Additionally, the shaded polygon in SVG 1 is a diamond that includes the apex as a vertex, which corresponds to a vertical or facet-like region, not a horizontal cutting plane (a true horizontal slice would not pass through the apex). The choice images (SVGs 2–5) are consistent with their intended shapes, and the designated correct option (square) aligns with the conceptual math. However, the orientation description and the depiction of the highlighted region in the main diagram conflict with the textual description of an upside-down pyramid and a horizontal cut.
- nice_x5bc8b7385a25dc55_76260 -> The item stem and choices require comparing two departments (Sales vs Engineering) using box plots, and the feedback explicitly discusses Engineering having a higher center and more variability than Sales. However, the provided SVG shows only a single box-and-whisker plot (with min≈10, Q1≈20, median≈35, Q3≈50, max≈80 on a 0–90 axis) and contains no second box plot or labels distinguishing Sales and Engineering. Because only one distribution is displayed, the diagram does not support any comparison between departments, contradicting the text and the declared correct responses (A and B). Thus the visual information is inconsistent with the item content and feedback.
- nice_xbf302ff9da9553c8_20605 -> The textual/mathematical information states Rectangle K is a scaled copy of Rectangle J, with areas 2 and 32 respectively. The feedback uses these values (32/2 = 16) to derive a scale factor of 4, which is consistent with the area labels in the diagram. However, the SVG’s actual geometry contradicts the “scaled copy” claim: Rectangle J is drawn 50×100 and Rectangle K is drawn 150×190. The width ratio is 3 and the height ratio is 1.9, so the rectangles are not similar and do not reflect a uniform scale factor (nor a factor of 4 implied by the areas). Thus, the visual diagram is inconsistent with the textual statement and the implied scale factor, even though the numeric area labels themselves match the calculations.
- nice_x141c0caeea18da08_98566 -> The item stem and main diagram (SVG 1) depict a right square pyramid intersected by a vertical plane offset from the center, which correctly suggests a trapezoid cross-section rather than a triangle or pentagon. The declared correct answer is choice A, whose SVG (SVG 2) indeed shows a trapezoid, aligning with the prompt and overall intent. However, the feedback explicitly states that the cross-section is an isosceles trapezoid. The geometry of choice A’s trapezoid is not isosceles based on its SVG coordinates: the non-parallel sides have different lengths (approximately 204 vs 171.6 units), so the rendered figure is a general trapezoid, not isosceles. This creates a contradiction between the textual feedback and the choice diagram representing the correct answer. No other numeric or diagrammatic contradictions are apparent in the stem or other options, and there is no MathML present to cross-check. The inconsistency therefore pertains to the response interaction that designates A as correct while describing it specifically as an isosceles trapezoid in feedback.
- nice_x173d999a33a18c53_33650 -> The item stem states that the lower box plot represents the men’s long jump distances at the 2020 World Championships, but the SVG explicitly labels the lower plot as “Olympics.” The feedback also consistently refers to the lower plot as the world‑championship distribution. This is a content mismatch between the diagram and the textual/feedback description of the dataset. Aside from this labeling issue, the numerical features shown in the box plots (medians and spread: U.S. qualifier median ≈ 7.74, world/“Olympics” median ≈ 8.04; larger range and IQR for the lower plot) are consistent with the stated correct answers (A and C) and the feedback explanation. Minor pixel-level axis spacing irregularities do not affect interpretation, but the event-name discrepancy contradicts the item text.
- nice_x4e7c075969d0ab5d_87868 -> The item text and feedback state that Asha’s probability is 0.3 and Byron’s is 0.1, so Kai’s probability must be 1 − 0.3 − 0.1 = 0.6. The choices mark 0.6 (D) as correct. In the SVG bar chart: Asha’s bar is drawn from y=252 to 360 (height 108), matching 0.3; Byron’s bar is from y=324 to 360 (height 36), matching 0.1. However, Kai’s dashed outline bar is drawn from y=180 to 360 (height 180), which corresponds to 0.5 (the 0.5 gridline is at y=180). If Kai were 0.6, the top should be at y=144. Thus, the diagram depicts Kai as 0.5, contradicting the text, feedback, and correct response (0.6).
- nice_x40415f39bb2d546d_63223 -> The SVG shows two straight lines intersecting at O: AB from (80,80) to (320,320) has slope 1, and CD from (320,80) to (80,320) has slope −1. Since the slopes are negative reciprocals, the lines are perpendicular and all four angles at O are right angles (90°). The angle arcs drawn also span from directions 45°↔135° (bottom) and 225°↔315° (top), each a 90° arc. However, the diagram labels the bottom angle as 120° and the top opposite angle as x, and the item’s correct response and feedback assert x = 120° by vertical angles. This contradicts the geometry actually depicted (which would make both those angles 90°, not 120°). Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the textual/MathML information and the scoring key.
- nice_x0201659c2893f524_65151 -> Parsed item prompt: choose the number line model for −3/4 + (−1/4). The response declaration marks choice A as correct. Feedback explains that the correct model moves left 3/4 from 0 to −3/4, then left another 1/4 to −4/4 = −1. Analysis of the SVGs: - Choice A (SVG 1) shows a move from 0 (x=210) left to −3/4 (x=138.75), labeled “−3/4,” then another left move of 1/4 to x=115 (−1), labeled “−1/4.” The final point is at −1. This matches the text and feedback. - Choice B (SVG 2) shows −3/4 then +1/4 (ends at −1/2), so it intentionally does not match the expression. - Choice C (SVG 3) shows +3/4 then +1/4 (ends at +1), also intentionally does not match. However, all three SVGs share the same number line axis labels, and there is a labeling error: the tick at x=67.5 is labeled “−2 2/4.” Given the scale (0 at x=210, −1 at x=115, 1 unit = 95 px, so each 1/4 = 23.75 px), x=67.5 corresponds to −1.5, which should be “−1 2/4,” not “−2 2/4” (which would mean −2.5). The other midpoints are correctly labeled (e.g., 162.5 is “−1 2/4,” 257.5 is “2/4,” 352.5 is “1 2/4”). This mislabel is a visual inconsistency within the diagrams relative to the numeric scale and the conventional meaning of the mixed number labels, even though the step arrows in choice A correctly model −3/4 + (−1/4). Because the mislabeled axis appears in the images presented to the learner, the item’s visual information is not fully consistent.
- nice_x62964f1824b8dd7e_26796 -> The SVG shows a straight line A–O–C with O as the vertex, a vertical ray OB, and two additional rays OE and OF in the upper-left quadrant. Angle labels: x is the angle from OA (left) up to OF; the small arcs 20° (between OF and OE) and 25° (between OE and OB). A right-angle marker indicates ∠AOB = 90°. From the diagram, the correct geometric relationship is x + 20° + 25° = 90°, so x = 90° − (20° + 25°) = 45°, which matches the declared correct response. However, the feedback text and MathML state “Vertical angles have equal measure” and then assert x = 20° + 25° = 45°. The diagram does not present x as a vertical angle to the sum of the two labeled angles; instead, those two angles are complementary with x to make 90°. Thus, while the final numeric answer (45°) is consistent with the figure, the stated reasoning and the equation x = 20° + 25° are not supported by the geometry shown. This constitutes an inconsistency between the diagram and the textual/MathML explanation.
- nice_x0dbcf089ab8d9887_19321 -> The diagram shows points A (vertex), D (to the right), E (up-left), and B (down-left). The blue angle arc is drawn at A between rays AE and AD, so the marked angle is ∠EAD. The declared correct answer (choice B: ∠EAD) and the feedback both align with the diagram. However, choice C is ∠CDA, which references a point C that does not appear anywhere in the SVG diagram. This creates a mismatch between the textual options and the visual labels, making the item inconsistent even though the correct answer itself is consistent with the diagram.
- nice_x14e12de20298cdfe_80271 -> The item stem and choices refer to Chicago and Detroit, but the SVG labels the box plots as St. Louis and Washington, D.C. This is a direct mismatch between the textual content and the visual diagram. The feedback also references Detroit having a higher median and Chicago having a larger spread; however, the diagram’s medians and spreads pertain to Washington, D.C. (median ≈ 30.67°C) and St. Louis (median ≈ 29.5°C), with St. Louis having the larger IQR. While the direction of the comparison (second city hotter on average) happens to match the keyed answer B, the cities named in the diagram are not the ones named in the item text, choices, or feedback. Additionally, the title mentions two Midwestern cities; Washington, D.C. is not a Midwestern city. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the text and feedback, which compromises the validity of the interaction.
- nice_x3bf7f3a9ae95e0de_20331 -> Parsed item: A wooden L-shaped block is painted on all outside surfaces (including the bottom). The response box is followed by the unit cm^2. The correct response in the XML is 1360 with feedback stating 1360 cm^2. Diagram analysis: The SVG shows an extruded L-shaped prism with dimensions explicitly labeled in meters: depth = 10 m; left rectangle (front face component) 10 m × 20 m; right rectangle (front face component) 10 m × 19 m. From the SVG path, the front L cross-section is the union of two non-overlapping rectangles of areas 10×20 and 10×19, so area(front) = 390 (in the diagram’s units). Its perimeter is 80 (edges: 10 + 1 + 10 + 19 + 20 + 20). For a prism of depth 10, total painted surface area = 2 × area(front) + depth × perimeter = 2×390 + 10×80 = 780 + 800 = 1580 square units. If the labeled units are meters, that is 1580 m^2 (i.e., 15,800,000 cm^2). If one instead treats the labeled numbers as centimeters, the result is 1580 cm^2. In all cases, the diagram-based computation does not match the keyed answer 1360, and the units are inconsistent because the diagram uses meters while the answer and prompt use cm^2. Therefore, the SVG diagram is not consistent with the textual/MathML information and the scored answer.
- nice_x80dc1341b9007790_30885 -> The stem states the solid is a right prism with a 3×3 square base and asks for the shape formed by a horizontal slice. The feedback also explains that a horizontal cross-section of a right prism is congruent to its base and therefore is a square. Among the choices, A’s SVG is a square (its polygon has equal width and height: 291.9239−108.0761 ≈ 183.8478 and 241.9239−58.0761 ≈ 183.8478), while B’s SVG is a non-square rectangle (373.3333−26.6667 = 346.6666 vs 280−20 = 260). However, the qti-correct-response is set to B. This contradicts both the mathematical principle stated in the feedback and the item stem (3×3 square base). The main diagram (SVG 1) depicts a right prism and a horizontal slice, consistent with a square cross-section when viewed in perspective, but the declared correct choice does not match. Therefore, the item’s diagrams and text are inconsistent with the keyed answer.
- nice_xc2dab77d822123a9_41715 -> The numeric reference in the student-facing text conflicts with the diagram and answer choices. The prompt (and the item title) ask to compare x to 79°, but the SVG diagram labels the given angle as 81° and the choice texts and feedback all reference 81° (with the keyed correct answer being x < 81°). Thus, the visual information (81°) is inconsistent with the textual prompt (79°), leading to a mismatch between the diagram and the MathML/text in the item body. Response processing also aligns with 81°, not 79°.
- nice_x2dd1602a6f6b9915_66467 -> The item text and feedback treat this as a triangle-inequality problem using only the two known side lengths a=5.6 and b=4, yielding the bounds 1.6 < x < 9.6. The SVG diagram, however, labels the triangle’s angles as A=50°, B=60°, C=70°, and the sides as AB=5.6, AC=4, BC=x. These fixed angle measures make the triangle’s side ratios determined; with AB opposite 70°, setting AB=5.6 fixes the scale and implies AC ≈ (sin60/sin70)*5.6 ≈ 5.16, not 4. Thus the diagram’s angles are inconsistent with the shown side lengths. Moreover, if the angles were to be taken as given, x would be uniquely determined (via Law of Cosines/Sines), not merely constrained to an interval. Therefore the visual information contradicts the mathematical scenario used in the item and feedback.

    "explanation": "The item text and feedback assert that the two marked angles are complementary (sum to 90°) with one marked as 42°, hence x = 48°. The SVG indeed shows a right-angle marker at point B between BA (vertical up) and BC (horizontal right), and two arc labels: “42°” between BA and a slanted ray BD, and “x” between BD and BC. However, the actual geometry of the drawn slanted ray BD (B at (200,200) to D at (300,120)) creates angles that do not match 42° and 48°: • The angle between BA (up) and BD is approximately 51.3° (vector BD = (100, -80): cosθ = 80/√(100²+80²) ≈ 0.6247 ⇒ θ ≈ 51.3°). • Consequently, the angle between BD and BC (right) is about 38.7° (90° − 51.3°), not 48°. The arcs in the SVG confirm these rays: the first arc starts on BA (M 200 150) and ends on the BD direction (239.0434,168.7652 lies on line B→D), labeled “42°”; the second arc runs from near BD to the rightward ray and is labeled “x”. Thus, visually measured angles (≈51.3° and ≈38.7°) contradict the textual/feedback values (42° and 48°). Therefore the diagram is not consistent with the stated numbers and the correct response of 48.",

    "explanation": "Parsed item: The prompt asks to find x from the figure. The diagram shows a straight line A–B–C with a ray BD above the line. Two adjacent angles at B are labeled: the left angle (between BA and BD) labeled “3x” and the right angle (between BD and BC) labeled “75°”. The feedback explicitly uses the linear pair relationship and forms the equation 3x + 75° = 180°, yielding x = 35.\n\nDiagram analysis: The SVG explicitly draws coordinates for the segments and arcs. B is at (210,160), C at (360,160), and D at (270,70). Thus BD has vector (60, -90), i.e., an angle of about 56.31° above the positive x-axis (since y is downward in SVG). The orange arc (75° label) is drawn from near the BD direction to the rightward horizontal; its path endpoints confirm an angular sweep of roughly 56.3°, not 75°. Correspondingly, the blue arc (3x label) spans the complementary angle of roughly 123.7° (180 - 56.3). Therefore, the drawn geometry suggests angle DBC ≈ 56.3°, which would imply 3x ≈ 123.7° and x ≈ 41.2°, not x = 35.\n\nConsistency check: While the textual math (3x + 75 = 180 → x = 35) is internally consistent and matches the numeric labels in the figure, the actual geometry encoded in the SVG (ray BD orientation and arc extents) does not match the labeled 75°. There is no indication that the diagram is not to scale. Hence, there is a visual-text inconsistency between the SVG geometry and the numeric value used in the problem/solution.\n\nConclusion: The item is inconsistent because the right-hand angle drawn is ~56° rather than the labeled 75°, which also alters the implied solution for x if interpreted from the drawing.",

In the SVG, two lines intersect forming an X from (80,80)–(320,320) and (320,80)–(80,320). These are perpendicular (slopes ±1), so all four angles at O are right angles. The two highlighted angle arcs are explicitly drawn as 90° arcs: one path from (236.77,163.23) to (236.77,236.77) and the opposite from (163.23,163.23) to (163.23,236.77), each spanning a quarter circle (90°). Despite this, the diagram text labels one region as “128°” and the opposite as “x”. Thus the visual geometry (90°) contradicts the stated angle measure (128°).

This creates a clear mismatch between the stated event distance and the numerical scale shown in the diagrams. While the dot plots themselves support the keyed answer (“None of the above,” since finals appear faster on average and more variable than semifinals), the fundamental inconsistency between the event described in the text and the time scale in the graphic remains. Additionally, within the SVG, several circle x-positions do not precisely align with the commented numeric values (e.g., a circle at x=350 maps to ~53.35 s, yet the comment lists 53.5), though these comments are not learner-visible.

The feedback text (both CORRECT and INCORRECT blocks) states that the angles form a linear pair and are supplementary, summing to 180°. Diagram analysis: The SVG shows two lines intersecting at approximately (170,150): a horizontal line (y=150) and a diagonal line from (200,60) to (110,330). The angle arcs indicate ∠m in the upper-right small (acute) region (between the rightward horizontal ray and the up-right diagonal ray) and ∠n in the lower-left small (acute) region (between the leftward horizontal ray and the down-left diagonal ray). These two angles are opposite each other at the intersection, hence they are vertical angles (congruent acute angles), not a linear pair. A linear pair would be adjacent angles sharing a common side whose other sides form a straight line; m and n do not share a side and do not sum to 180°.

If the diagram’s dimensions were used with V = 0.375 m³, then 0.375 = (1/2)(1.5)(0.5) l = 0.375 l, giving l = 1 m, which contradicts the expected answer l = 1.5 m.

    "explanation": "The SVG shows a straight line A–O–C with O as the vertex, a vertical ray OB, and two additional rays OE and OF in the upper-left quadrant. Angle labels: x is the angle from OA (left) up to OF; the small arcs 20° (between OF and OE) and 25° (between OE and OB). A right-angle marker indicates ∠AOB = 90°. From the diagram, the correct geometric relationship is x + 20° + 25° = 90°, so x = 90° − (20° + 25°) = 45°, which matches the declared correct response. However, the feedback text and MathML state “Vertical angles have equal measure” and then assert x = 20° + 25° = 45°. The diagram does not present x as a vertical angle to the sum of the two labeled angles; instead, those two angles are complementary with x to make 90°. Thus, while the final numeric answer (45°) is consistent with the figure, the stated reasoning and the equation x = 20° + 25° are not supported by the geometry shown. This constitutes an inconsistency between the diagram and the textual/MathML explanation.",

    "explanation": "The diagram shows points A (vertex), D (to the right), E (up-left), and B (down-left). The blue angle arc is drawn at A between rays AE and AD, so the marked angle is ∠EAD. The declared correct answer (choice B: ∠EAD) and the feedback both align with the diagram. However, choice C is ∠CDA, which references a point C that does not appear anywhere in the SVG diagram. This creates a mismatch between the textual options and the visual labels, making the item inconsistent even though the correct answer itself is consistent with the diagram.",

    "explanation": "The item stem and choices refer to Chicago and Detroit, but the SVG labels the box plots as St. Louis and Washington, D.C. This is a direct mismatch between the textual content and the visual diagram. The feedback also references Detroit having a higher median and Chicago having a larger spread; however, the diagram’s medians and spreads pertain to Washington, D.C. (median ≈ 30.67°C) and St. Louis (median ≈ 29.5°C), with St. Louis having the larger IQR. While the direction of the comparison (second city hotter on average) happens to match the keyed answer B, the cities named in the diagram are not the ones named in the item text, choices, or feedback. Additionally, the title mentions two Midwestern cities; Washington, D.C. is not a Midwestern city. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the text and feedback, which compromises the validity of the interaction.",

    "explanation": "Parsed item: A wooden L-shaped block is painted on all outside surfaces (including the bottom). The response box is followed by the unit cm^2. The correct response in the XML is 1360 with feedback stating 1360 cm^2. Diagram analysis: The SVG shows an extruded L-shaped prism with dimensions explicitly labeled in meters: depth = 10 m; left rectangle (front face component) 10 m × 20 m; right rectangle (front face component) 10 m × 19 m. From the SVG path, the front L cross-section is the union of two non-overlapping rectangles of areas 10×20 and 10×19, so area(front) = 390 (in the diagram’s units). Its perimeter is 80 (edges: 10 + 1 + 10 + 19 + 20 + 20). For a prism of depth 10, total painted surface area = 2 × area(front) + depth × perimeter = 2×390 + 10×80 = 780 + 800 = 1580 square units. If the labeled units are meters, that is 1580 m^2 (i.e., 15,800,000 cm^2). If one instead treats the labeled numbers as centimeters, the result is 1580 cm^2. In all cases, the diagram-based computation does not match the keyed answer 1360, and the units are inconsistent because the diagram uses meters while the answer and prompt use cm^2. Therefore, the SVG diagram is not consistent with the textual/MathML information and the scored answer.",

    "explanation": "The stem states the solid is a right prism with a 3×3 square base and asks for the shape formed by a horizontal slice. The feedback also explains that a horizontal cross-section of a right prism is congruent to its base and therefore is a square. Among the choices, A’s SVG is a square (its polygon has equal width and height: 291.9239−108.0761 ≈ 183.8478 and 241.9239−58.0761 ≈ 183.8478), while B’s SVG is a non-square rectangle (373.3333−26.6667 = 346.6666 vs 280−20 = 260). However, the qti-correct-response is set to B. This contradicts both the mathematical principle stated in the feedback and the item stem (3×3 square base). The main diagram (SVG 1) depicts a right prism and a horizontal slice, consistent with a square cross-section when viewed in perspective, but the declared correct choice does not match. Therefore, the item’s diagrams and text are inconsistent with the keyed answer.",

    "explanation": "The numeric reference in the student-facing text conflicts with the diagram and answer choices. The prompt (and the item title) ask to compare x to 79°, but the SVG diagram labels the given angle as 81° and the choice texts and feedback all reference 81° (with the keyed correct answer being x < 81°). Thus, the visual information (81°) is inconsistent with the textual prompt (79°), leading to a mismatch between the diagram and the MathML/text in the item body. Response processing also aligns with 81°, not 79°.",

    "explanation": "The item text and feedback treat this as a triangle-inequality problem using only the two known side lengths a=5.6 and b=4, yielding the bounds 1.6 < x < 9.6. The SVG diagram, however, labels the triangle’s angles as A=50°, B=60°, C=70°, and the sides as AB=5.6, AC=4, BC=x. These fixed angle measures make the triangle’s side ratios determined; with AB opposite 70°, setting AB=5.6 fixes the scale and implies AC ≈ (sin60/sin70)*5.6 ≈ 5.16, not 4. Thus the diagram’s angles are inconsistent with the shown side lengths. Moreover, if the angles were to be taken as given, x would be uniquely determined (via Law of Cosines/Sines), not merely constrained to an interval. Therefore the visual information contradicts the mathematical scenario used in the item and feedback.",
