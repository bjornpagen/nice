Failing items for nice_x0267d782 (count=38):
- nice_x739ada47a499180b_24385 -> Parsed item: The prompt asks for the total surface area of the triangular prism shown. The only response interaction (RESPONSE) expects an integer; the correct answer is set to 516. The feedback reiterates that 516 square units is the correct total surface area. Diagram analysis (decoded SVG): The front triangular base is drawn isosceles with a dashed altitude from the apex to the midpoint of the base. Labels shown are: base = 12 (at the front triangle base), height of the triangle (altitude) = 10 (next to the dashed line), and prism length = 14 (label near the lateral direction). Thus, the given dimensions are: triangle base b = 12, triangle altitude h = 10, prism length L = 14. Implications: - Area of one triangular base A = 1/2 · b · h = 1/2 · 12 · 10 = 60. Two bases total 120. - For lateral surface area, we need the perimeter P of the triangle. The drawing indicates an isosceles triangle (altitude to midpoint), so the equal side length s = sqrt((b/2)^2 + h^2) = sqrt(6^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(136) ≈ 11.662. Hence P ≈ 12 + 2·11.662 ≈ 35.324. - Lateral area ≈ L · P = 14 · 35.324 ≈ 494.5. Total surface area ≈ 494.5 + 120 ≈ 614.5, not 516. Moreover, with the given labels (12, 10, 14), there is no way to obtain 516. If the correct total were 516, the required perimeter would be P = (516 − 2A)/L = (516 − 120)/14 = 396/14 ≈ 28.286, which is impossible for any triangle with base 12 and altitude 10 (even the isosceles case already gives P ≈ 35.324, and other shapes would have greater perimeter for these constraints). Therefore, the numeric answer 516 is inconsistent with the diagram’s dimensions, and the diagram lacks sufficient side-length information to justify that answer. Conclusion: The diagram and the provided correct response (516) do not align; the item is inconsistent.
- nice_x9587af88ffcf3b55_40594 -> The item asks for the area of the triangle and the feedback computes it using base = 24 and height = 12, yielding 1/2 * 24 * 12 = 144. The SVG diagram labels the base with “24” and the vertical height with “12”, which matches the numbers used in the text and feedback. However, the SVG also labels the angles as 90°, 60°, and 30°. With a right angle at A and legs 24 (base) and 12 (height), the acute angles should be arctan(12/24) ≈ 26.565° at B and 63.435° at C, not 60° and 30°. In a true 30-60-90 triangle the legs must be in a 1:√3 ratio, whereas the diagram’s legs are in a 2:1 ratio; the hypotenuse would be 12√5 ≈ 26.83, not consistent with 30-60-90 expectations. Thus, the diagram’s angle labels contradict the side lengths and the geometry implied by the calculation, creating an inconsistency. The affected interaction is the single text entry response.
- nice_xc2447957e8fc9097_93400 -> Parsed item: The prompt states the triangle has area 30 square units. The diagram shows a triangle ABC with base AB labeled 5 and a dashed altitude from C to AB labeled x (with a right-angle marker). The feedback computes x from Area = 1/2 * base * height, using base = 5 and area = 30, yielding x = 12, which is consistent with the text and the base label. However, the diagram also explicitly labels the interior angles as 50° at A, 60° at B, and 70° at C. For a triangle with angles A=50°, B=60°, C=70° and base AB = 5, the altitude to AB is h = 5*(sin50°*sin60°)/sin70° ≈ 3.53, giving area ≈ 1/2 * 5 * 3.53 ≈ 8.83, not 30. Conversely, if area is 30 and base is 5, the required altitude is 12, which is incompatible with the depicted angle measures (the base angles implied by such a height would not be 50° and 60°). Therefore, the visual information (angle measures) contradicts the textual/mathematical information (area 30 leading to x = 12).
- nice_xcf9144cd5aaae605_25413 -> Parsed item body: The prompt asks for the value marked with a question mark on a vertical number line. The response is an integer with the correct answer keyed as -9. The SVG shows a vertical line with 7 evenly spaced ticks from y=20 (top) to y=400 (bottom). Only the top and bottom ticks are labeled: top is -4 (text at y≈25 near the y=20 tick) and bottom is -10 (text at y≈405 near the y=400 tick). Therefore, across 6 equal intervals from top to bottom, the values decrease by 6 total units, implying each tick step is 1 unit: -4 (top), -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10 (bottom). The plotted point (circle) is at y=336.6667, which is the second tick from the bottom, corresponding to -9. This matches the keyed correct response and the “Correct!” feedback that states the point is at -9. However, the “Incorrect” feedback text states: “Each tick mark represents three units. Starting at 0, count downward by threes: -3, -6, -9.” This contradicts the diagram’s labels (-4 at the top and -10 at the bottom) and the tick spacing implied by those labels (1 unit per tick). The diagram does not show 0, nor does it reflect steps of 3 units per tick. Therefore, while the answer value (-9) matches the plotted point, the explanatory feedback about the scale is inconsistent with the SVG diagram.
- nice_xbaf90abe21a83789_33593 -> The item asks students to match an equation to a tape diagram. The choices and feedback indicate that the intended relationship is 3/10 + x = 4/5 (choice A is marked correct and reiterated in the CORRECT feedback). In the SVG: (1) The top tape (y=40) is partitioned into tenths (vertical lines at 30.4-unit intervals across a 304-unit bar). It shows 91.2 units (3/10) solid plus 152 units hatched beginning at x=111.2, which is exactly 5/10. This visually encodes x = 1/2, consistent with 4/5 − 3/10 = 5/10. (2) The bottom tape (y=110) is partitioned into fifths (vertical lines at x=80.8, 141.6, 202.4, 263.2), but the red fill rectangle spans the full width of the bar: width 304 (5/5 = 1 whole). If the diagram were to represent 4/5, the bottom fill should be 4 of the 5 fifths (width 243.2), not the full 5/5. Because the bottom tape is fully filled, the two tapes do not represent equal totals as the feedback states. As drawn, the bottom represents 1 while the top filled/hatched total is 3/10 + 5/10 = 8/10, contradicting the stated equation 3/10 + x = 4/5. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the text and MathML.
- nice_x3efa8c77671c849e_18761 -> The SVG labels the prism with dimensions 3, 4, 5 on the triangular base (a 3-4-5 right triangle) and 8 as the prism length. Therefore, each triangular face has area 1/2·3·4 = 6 (two triangles: 6 + 6), and the three rectangular faces have areas 3·8 = 24, 4·8 = 32, and 5·8 = 40. The total surface area should be expressed as 6 + 6 + 24 + 32 + 40 (or 12 + 8·(3 + 4 + 5)). However, the item’s designated correct choice (A) and the feedback use 10 + 10 + 15 + 12 + 7, asserting two triangle areas of 10 and rectangle areas 15, 12, and 7. These numbers (10, 15, 12, 7) do not correspond to the dimensions shown in the diagram (3, 4, 5, 8). Notably, the diagram contains an 8 (prism length) which is not reflected in the chosen expression, and the expression includes a 7, which is not present in the diagram. Hence, the diagram is inconsistent with the textual/MathML information and the keyed answer/feedback.
- nice_x934e10cf2ea0e7e4_71376 -> The item states that each 10×10 grid represents one whole and asks, “What percent of the total area is shaded?” Two 10×10 grids are shown in the SVGs. Counting shaded squares from the diagrams: SVG 1 has 9 fully shaded rows and the last row unshaded (90 shaded squares). SVG 2 has 8 fully shaded rows plus 6 shaded squares in the ninth row (86 shaded squares). Total shaded across both grids = 90 + 86 = 176 squares. Since each grid has 100 squares, the combined total area across the two grids is 200 squares. Therefore, the percent of the total area that is shaded should be (176/200)×100% = 88%. However, the item’s correct response is set to 176 with feedback stating “The shaded area represents 176%,” which interprets the shaded count as a percent of a single 100-square whole rather than of the total area of both grids. This conflicts with the stem’s wording (“percent of the total area”), which implies the denominator should be the combined 200-square area. Thus, the diagrams (176 shaded out of 200) contradict the keyed answer (176%).
- nice_x270f8e23bed25b31_99306 -> The item asks for an expression for the total surface area of the shown right triangular prism. The SVG labels indicate: triangle base = 8 (bottom of the front triangle), a triangle side = 5 (left side), and prism depth = 11. This implies the three rectangular lateral faces have areas 8×11 = 88 and two faces of 5×11 = 55 each, which matches the 88 and 55 values used in the options. For the triangular bases, with side lengths 5, 5, and 8 (consistent with two 55 rectangles and one 88 rectangle), the triangle’s altitude is sqrt(5^2 − (8/2)^2) = sqrt(25 − 16) = 3, so each triangle’s area is (1/2)·8·3 = 12. Therefore, the total surface area should include 2·12 for the two triangles, not 2·8. However, the item’s designated correct answer (choice A) and the CORRECT feedback both assert 2·8 + 2·55 + 88, which undercounts the triangular areas and contradicts the diagram. No option provided matches the diagram-consistent total (2·12 + 2·55 + 88). Hence, the diagram is inconsistent with the keyed answer and feedback.
- nice_x17d286c5fd268ced_42829 -> The textual/mathematical content states that 270 people corresponds to 125% of last year's attendance, and the expected table values are 125% → 270, 25% → 54, and 100% → 216. The SVG labels also place 270 on the People line aligned with 125% on the Percent line, which matches the numbers. However, the geometry of the percent axis in the SVG is not proportional: the tick positions are equally spaced at x = 20 (0%), 130 (25%), 240 (50%), 350 (100%), and 460 (125). This makes the 50%→100% jump (50 percentage points) the same physical distance as the 0%→25% and 25%→50% jumps (25 percentage points each). Specifically, the 0→100% distance is 330 px (20 to 350) while 0→125% is 440 px (20 to 460), giving a ratio of 1.333…, not the 1.25 required for a proportional double number line. Consequently, the diagram’s scale contradicts the proportional relationship implied by the text and the intended method (dividing 125% into five equal 25% parts). This mis-scaling affects how one would visually infer 25% and 100% from 125%, even though the numeric labels themselves are correct.
- nice_xbc78fdd06685c4d8_95479 -> From the SVG: the axes intersect at (0,0) at (x=226.7, y=200). Plotted points are labeled: Art at (226.7,200) → (0,0); Library at (242.03,200) → (1,0); Science at (272.69,200) → (3,0); Cafeteria at (119.39,56) → (-7,9). Distances from Art: to Library is 1 unit; to Science is 3 units, so the statement “Art is closer to Science than to the Library” is false. The item’s correct response for dropdown_1 is FALSE, which matches the diagram. The Cafeteria’s coordinates are (-7,9), matching both the diagram and the correct response TRUE for dropdown_2. However, the CORRECT feedback text says, “Art is closer to Science than to the Library,” which contradicts the diagram (and the key). Therefore, there is an inconsistency between the diagram and the textual feedback for the first statement.
- nice_x70d4ff682334d643_26992 -> The prompt asks for the ratio of turtles to the total number of animals. The SVG shows 4 turtles and 7 other animals, which means the total number of animals is 11. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 4:11. However, the item’s correct answer is set to choice A (4 for every 7), and the feedback also states 4 for every 7, which would correspond to turtles to other animals, not turtles to total animals. The diagram (4 turtles + 7 others) contradicts the textual prompt and the declared correct response/feedback. Additionally, 4:11 is not offered among the choices, reinforcing the inconsistency.
- nice_x24f798bd_27551 -> The item asks: “Which point is the opposite of −3 on the number line?” The response declaration marks C as correct, and feedback states the opposite of −3 is point C. In the SVG, the number line is labeled from −6 to 6 with points plotted: A at 0 (x=240), B at −2 (x≈166.67), C at −3 (x=130), D at +3 (x=350), and E at −4 (x≈93.33). The mathematical opposite of −3 is +3, which corresponds to point D in the diagram, not point C. Therefore, the diagram indicates D is correct, while the XML’s correct-response and feedback assert C, creating a direct inconsistency.
- nice_x7e43407413526d13_43282 -> The item text and feedback state a constant unit ratio of 1:6 (one adult to six children), and the expected answers (48, 11, 90) align with that ratio. However, the SVG double number line is not linearly scaled with its numeric labels: on the Adults line, tick marks are equally spaced but labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, skipping 8, 10, and 11 while maintaining the same spacing. Correspondingly, on the Children line, the labels at the same equally spaced ticks are 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 54, 72, causing jumps of +12 and +18 over single equal intervals near the end. This violates the uniform scaling expected of a number line and contradicts the visual implication of equal spacing per unit. While the numeric pairs still reflect a 1:6 ratio at the labeled points (e.g., 1→6, 12→72), the diagram’s tick spacing vs. labels is inconsistent with a proper double number line and could misrepresent the relationship visually relative to the text and feedback.
- nice_x46737fa249a0abbc_56803 -> The item text states there are 6 sessions total: “A tutoring center listed 6 sessions, each with a different hourly rate.” It further specifies that these rates are all between $15 and $20 per hour, except for one session at $40. This implies 5 rates between $15–$20 and 1 outlier at $40, for a total of 6 data points. However, the SVG number line displays 7 data points: six cyan points at 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 (positions x≈82.86, 95.43, 108, 120.57, 133.14, 145.71) plus one red point at 40 (x≈397.14). Therefore, the diagram shows 6 within 15–20 plus an additional at 40 (total 7), contradicting the stated total of 6 sessions. All other labels and the presence of the outlier at 40 are consistent, but the count of data points is not.
- nice_x6f8ee34f57d09299_68521 -> The item asks for the total surface area of a triangular prism tent, including the floor, and provides a correct answer of 52.8 m^2. The SVG shows only two explicit dimensions: 5.2 m (along the length of the prism) and 1.5 m (near the triangular end). No base width of the triangular cross-section (the floor width) is labeled, nor is the slant edge length labeled. To compute the total surface area of a triangular prism including the floor, one needs the prism length and sufficient dimensions of the triangular cross-section (e.g., base width and height, or base and slant, etc.). With only 5.2 m and 1.5 m, the problem is under-specified. Moreover, the provided answer 52.8 m^2 implies additional dimensions not shown in the diagram: it is exactly obtained if length L = 5.2 m, triangle height h = 1.5 m, and base width w = 4.0 m (yielding slant s = 2.5 m), giving SA = L·w + 2·L·s + w·h = 20.8 + 26.0 + 6.0 = 52.8. Neither w = 4 m nor s = 2.5 m appears in the SVG. If the 1.5 m label is instead interpreted as the slant length (which its placement near the slanted edge could suggest), then even optimistically the total area cannot reach 52.8 m^2; with s = 1.5 m the maximum achievable SA is far below 52.8. Thus the diagram does not provide all necessary dimensions and is ambiguous relative to the stated correct value, making the visual information inconsistent with the item’s expected numerical result.
- nice_x5dc5fe9bdfc54ce4_36814 -> The text and feedback state the equation h + 26 = 42, yielding h = 16. The SVG shows a top tape split into two parts labeled h and 26, summing to a bottom tape labeled 42, which conceptually matches the equation. However, the visual dimensions are not consistent with the numbers: the top segment labeled h has width 228 px and the segment labeled 26 has width 152 px, making h visually larger than 26. Given the solution h = 16 < 26, the relative lengths should reflect h being shorter than the 26 segment if the tape diagram is to scale. Moreover, using the bottom tape (42) with width 380 px implies ~9.05 px per unit; then 26 should be about 235 px and h (16) about 145 px, but the SVG uses approximately the opposite (26 ≈ 152 px, h ≈ 228 px). Therefore, the diagram’s proportions contradict the numeric relationship presented in the text/feedback, making the item visually inconsistent with its stated values.
- nice_x1b66164ecd8c37ea_12372 -> The item asks which x-coordinate is larger, s or t, and the correct response is set to t (B). The SVG shows a coordinate grid with labeled ticks every 2 units. It draws a parallelogram with vertices intended (per on-diagram labels) to be (s,2), (-1,4), (t,4), (1,2), and it labels the two reference points as “(-1, 4)” and “(1, 2)”. However, the plotted x-positions of those two labeled reference points do not match the axis scale: the point labeled “(-1, 4)” is drawn at x=226.15, which is the x-tick for −2, not −1; the point labeled “(1, 2)” is drawn at x=287.25, which is the x-tick for +2, not +1. Thus, the diagram’s plotted coordinates contradict both the axis labels and the text/feedback that reference (−1,4) and (1,2). Additionally, the polygon’s left vertex (s,2) is at x≈180.8 (≈−5), whereas an internal SVG comment claims s=−3; although comments are not visible to test-takers, this further shows mismatch within the diagram specification. Despite these issues, the relative comparison t > s still holds visually (t ≈ +5, s ≈ −5), so the keyed answer remains B. Nevertheless, the diagram-text inconsistency over the specific reference coordinates (−1,4) and (1,2) means the item is not fully consistent.
- nice_xf66ab2278e4a05f2_28666 -> The item text says the grid below shows the age of each of eight students when they started kindergarten and asks for a frequency table for ages 3, 4, and 5 with counts (feedback states 3→1, 4→5, 5→2). However, the SVG is a box-and-whisker plot labeled “Books finished,” with a horizontal axis from 0 to 20 and quartiles/whiskers at values corresponding to 3, 7, 10, 13, and 18. This is not a grid of individual ages, does not display eight discrete data points, and is about “Books finished,” not ages. None of the frequencies 1, 5, 2 for ages 3–5 can be derived from this box plot. Therefore, the diagram contradicts the narrative and the feedback/expected answers.
- nice_x5c4e703d0618a532_67034 -> The SVG shows a right triangle with sides labeled 6 (base AB) and 8 (height BC), and angle measures labeled 40° at A, 90° at B, and 50° at C. The item text and feedback compute the area using base = 6 and height = 8, yielding 24, which is mathematically correct for a right triangle with those leg lengths. However, in a right triangle with legs 6 and 8, the acute angles should be approximately 53.13° and 36.87°, not 40° and 50°. Thus, the angle labels in the diagram contradict the side length labels used in the solution, creating an internal inconsistency within the visual information relative to the numerical data referenced in the text/feedback.
- nice_x6e36f052a481795a_45478 -> The SVG shows a single right trapezoid with dimensions labeled 8 (bottom base), 6 (top base), and 4 (height). These numeric labels match the feedback calculations that use base lengths 6 and 8 with height 4 to obtain triangle areas 12 and 16 and a total of 28, so the numerical data are consistent. However, the text states, “This diagram consists of 2 triangles,” and the table asks for areas of “Triangle A” and “Triangle B,” yet the SVG does not depict any subdivision of the trapezoid into two triangles (no diagonal or shading/partition is shown, nor are parts labeled A/B). This structural mismatch makes the diagram inconsistent with the textual description of two triangles, even though the numbers themselves align.
- nice_x2e255b756911f229_58154 -> The item asks for the graph of a quadrilateral with vertices at (2,6), (-3,6), (-5,3), and (-5,-1). The feedback reiterates this, specifying the left side on x = -5 from y = -1 to y = 3 and the top on y = 6 from x = -3 to x = 2. Examining the decoded SVGs for the choices using the provided axis mapping (y=104 → 6, y=136 → 4, y=152 → 5, y=168 → 2, y=200 → 0, y=216 → -1; x=257.36 → 2, x=180.71 → -3, x=150.05 → -5): - Choice B (declared correct) has polygon points at (2,6), (-3,6), (-5,5), and (-5,-1). The left vertical side is from y = -1 up to y = 5, not up to y = 3. Thus it does not match the required (-5,3). - Choice A shows the left side from y = 1 to y = 5, also incorrect. - Choice C shows the left side from y = -1 to y = 5 and the top-left at x = -4 instead of -3, also incorrect. Therefore no provided graph matches the stated vertices, while the item’s correct-response is set to B. This is inconsistent with the text and feedback.
- nice_x6798155e9cdba62c_53320 -> The SVG shows a tape partitioned into 10 equal sections (vertical lines at uniform 38px intervals across an outer 380px bar), which is consistent with the text/feedback statement that each section is 1/10 of the whole. However, the filled (blue) rectangle spans exactly 7 of the 10 sections (266px = 7×38px), visually emphasizing 7/10 of the bar. In the item text and feedback, 70 haircuts is stated to represent 100% (the whole), 7 haircuts to represent 10% (one section), and 63 haircuts to represent 90% (nine sections). If the whole bar is the 70-haircut total, then one section corresponds to 7 haircuts; shading seven sections would represent 49 haircuts (70%), not 70 (100%). The diagram therefore visually suggests 70% of the whole rather than the whole itself, and it does not illustrate the feedback’s nine-section (90%) case. This creates a mismatch between the diagram’s highlighted portion and the textual/MathML statements and correct answers.
- nice_xfb39038c01eceb5f_47018 -> The item asks for the total surface area of the shown right triangular prism and marks 180 as the correct answer. The SVG labels show: base of the triangular face = 10, height of the triangle = 5 (red dashed altitude), prism depth = 4, and an additional label “6.25” near a triangle side. Using the standard surface area formula for a right prism, SA = 2·(area of triangle) + (perimeter of triangle)·depth. From the base and height, triangle area = 1/2·10·5 = 25, so 2·area = 50. If the triangle is right-angled as implied by the perpendicular altitude to the base, the third side (hypotenuse) should be √(10^2 + 5^2) = √125 ≈ 11.18. Then the lateral area = (10 + 5 + 11.18)·4 ≈ 26.18·4 ≈ 104.72, and total surface area ≈ 50 + 104.72 = 154.72, not 180. Alternatively, if “6.25” were intended to be the slanted side length, the lateral area would be (10 + 5 + 6.25)·4 = 21.25·4 = 85, giving a total of 50 + 85 = 135, also not 180. Furthermore, the label “6.25” conflicts with the base-height pair (10 and 5): an isosceles interpretation with legs 6.25 and base 10 would imply a triangle height of 3.75, not 5. Therefore, the diagram’s dimensions are inconsistent with the provided correct numeric answer and with each other.

    "explanation": "The item asks for the percent of the circle that is shaded and expects 50% as the correct answer, with feedback stating the shaded portion is 50% of the circle. In the SVG, a blue path (fill #87CEEB) is defined as a sector from the center to the rightmost point and an arc to the leftmost point, representing exactly a semicircle (50%). However, the next element is a white-filled circle (<circle ... fill=\"#FFFFFF\" .../>) drawn after the path. Because SVG renders in document order, this white-filled circle completely covers the previously drawn blue sector. As a result, the visible diagram shows an unshaded white circle with a black outline, not a half-shaded circle. This contradicts the text prompt asking about a shaded region and the expected answer of 50%. Therefore, the diagram as rendered is inconsistent with the item’s text and scoring.",

However, the same SVG also labels the other two angles as 40° (at A) and 50° (at C). A right triangle with legs 6 and 8 has acute angles approximately 36.87° and 53.13°, not 40° and 50°.

Its area from the diagram would be 2·2 = 4, but the feedback text asserts “Triangle B: 2 square units,” which only holds if B were a right triangle of legs 2 and 2.

Consequently, the stated composition “3 triangles and 1 rectangle” conflicts with the SVG (which shows 2 triangles and 2 rectangles).

The only response interaction (RESPONSE) expects an integer; the correct answer is set to 516. The feedback reiterates that 516 square units is the correct total surface area.\n\nDiagram analysis (decoded SVG): The front triangular base is drawn isosceles with a dashed altitude from the apex to the midpoint of the base. Labels shown are: base = 12 (at the front triangle base), height of the triangle (altitude) = 10 (next to the dashed line), and prism length = 14 (label near the lateral direction). Thus, the given dimensions are: triangle base b = 12, triangle altitude h = 10, prism length L = 14.\n\nImplications:\n- Area of one triangular base A = 1/2 · b · h = 1/2 · 12 · 10 = 60. Two bases total 120.\n- For lateral surface area, we need the perimeter P of the triangle. The drawing indicates an isosceles triangle (altitude to midpoint), so the equal side length s = sqrt((b/2)^2 + h^2) = sqrt(6^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(136) ≈ 11.662. Hence P ≈ 12 + 2·11.662 ≈ 35.324.\n- Lateral area ≈ L · P = 14 · 35.324 ≈ 494.5. Total surface area ≈ 494.5 + 120 ≈ 614.5, not 516.\n\nMoreover, with the given labels (12, 10, 14), there is no way to obtain 516. If the correct total were 516, the required perimeter would be P = (516 − 2A)/L = (516 − 120)/14 = 396/14 ≈ 28.286, which is impossible for any triangle with base 12 and altitude 10 (even the isosceles case already gives P ≈ 35.324, and other shapes would have greater perimeter for these constraints). Therefore, the numeric answer 516 is inconsistent with the diagram’s dimensions, and the diagram lacks sufficient side-length information to justify that answer.\n\nConclusion: The diagram and the provided correct response (516) do not align; the item is inconsistent.",

Under that correct scaling, the dot at x=86.666… corresponds to −12, matching the keyed answer and the feedback’s “3 units apart” claim.

The SVG labels also place 270 on the People line aligned with 125% on the Percent line, which matches the numbers. However, the geometry of the percent axis in the SVG is not proportional: the tick positions are equally spaced at x = 20 (0%), 130 (25%), 240 (50%), 350 (100%), and 460 (125). This makes the 50%→100% jump (50 percentage points) the same physical distance as the 0%→25% and 25%→50% jumps (25 percentage points each). Specifically, the 0→100% distance is 330 px (20 to 350) while 0→125% is 440 px (20 to 460), giving a ratio of 1.333…, not the 1.25 required for a proportional double number line. Consequently, the diagram’s scale contradicts the proportional relationship implied by the text and the intended method (dividing 125% into five equal 25% parts). This mis-scaling affects how one would visually infer 25% and 100% from 125%, even though the numeric labels themselves are correct.",

This violates the uniform scaling expected of a number line and contradicts the visual implication of equal spacing per unit.

    "explanation": "The item asks for the total surface area of a triangular prism tent, including the floor, and provides a correct answer of 52.8 m^2. The SVG shows only two explicit dimensions: 5.2 m (along the length of the prism) and 1.5 m (near the triangular end). No base width of the triangular cross-section (the floor width) is labeled, nor is the slant edge length labeled. To compute the total surface area of a triangular prism including the floor, one needs the prism length and sufficient dimensions of the triangular cross-section (e.g., base width and height, or base and slant, etc.). With only 5.2 m and 1.5 m, the problem is under-specified. Moreover, the provided answer 52.8 m^2 implies additional dimensions not shown in the diagram: it is exactly obtained if length L = 5.2 m, triangle height h = 1.5 m, and base width w = 4.0 m (yielding slant s = 2.5 m), giving SA = L·w + 2·L·s + w·h = 20.8 + 26.0 + 6.0 = 52.8. Neither w = 4 m nor s = 2.5 m appears in the SVG. If the 1.5 m label is instead interpreted as the slant length (which its placement near the slanted edge could suggest), then even optimistically the total area cannot reach 52.8 m^2; with s = 1.5 m the maximum achievable SA is far below 52.8. Thus the diagram does not provide all necessary dimensions and is ambiguous relative to the stated correct value, making the visual information inconsistent with the item’s expected numerical result.",

However, the visual dimensions are not consistent with the numbers: the top segment labeled h has width 228 px and the segment labeled 26 has width 152 px, making h visually larger than 26. Given the solution h = 16 < 26, the relative lengths should reflect h being shorter than the 26 segment if the tape diagram is to scale. Moreover, using the bottom tape (42) with width 380 px implies ~9.05 px per unit; then 26 should be about 235 px and h (16) about 145 px, but the SVG uses approximately the opposite (26 ≈ 152 px, h ≈ 228 px).

It draws a parallelogram with vertices intended (per on-diagram labels) to be (s,2), (-1,4), (t,4), (1,2), and it labels the two reference points as “(-1, 4)” and “(1, 2)”. However, the plotted x-positions of those two labeled reference points do not match the axis scale: the point labeled “(-1, 4)” is drawn at x=226.15, which is the x-tick for −2, not −1; the point labeled “(1, 2)” is drawn at x=287.25, which is the x-tick for +2, not +1. Thus, the diagram’s plotted coordinates contradict both the axis labels and the text/feedback that reference (−1,4) and (1,2). Additionally, the polygon’s left vertex (s,2) is at x≈180.8 (≈−5), whereas an internal SVG comment claims s=−3; although comments are not visible to test-takers, this further shows mismatch within the diagram specification. Despite these issues, the relative comparison t > s still holds visually (t ≈ +5, s ≈ −5), so the keyed answer remains B.

The SVG labels show: base of the triangular face = 10, height of the triangle = 5 (red dashed altitude), prism depth = 4, and an additional label “6.25” near a triangle side. Using the standard surface area formula for a right prism, SA = 2·(area of triangle) + (perimeter of triangle)·depth. From the base and height, triangle area = 1/2·10·5 = 25, so 2·area = 50. If the triangle is right-angled as implied by the perpendicular altitude to the base, the third side (hypotenuse) should be √(10^2 + 5^2) = √125 ≈ 11.18. Then the lateral area = (10 + 5 + 11.18)·4 ≈ 26.18·4 ≈ 104.72, and total surface area ≈ 50 + 104.72 = 154.72, not 180. Alternatively, if “6.25” were intended to be the slanted side length, the lateral area would be (10 + 5 + 6.25)·4 = 21.25·4 = 85, giving a total of 50 + 85 = 135, also not 180. Furthermore, the label “6.25” conflicts with the base-height pair (10 and 5): an isosceles interpretation with legs 6.25 and base 10 would imply a triangle height of 3.75, not 5.
