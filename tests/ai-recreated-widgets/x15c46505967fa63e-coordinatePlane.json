    "aiReasoning": "The original content contains a tape diagram representing ratios of planted to harvested trees, but this task is to recreate input for a coordinate plane widget. The given tape diagrams could conceptually fit into a coordinate grid by representing the number of trees planted and harvested against x-y axes if the task demands a visualization transformation. However, the original content and question context do not involve elements typically represented on a coordinate plane widget such as points, lines, or specific graph axes. Based on this discrepancy, a coordinate plane is an unsuitable choice for directly representing the tape diagrams.",
