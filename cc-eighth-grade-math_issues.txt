Failing items for nice_x7c7044d7 (count=98):
- nice_x70ad8a5cd632548c_13275 -> The item text and solution reasoning describe an isosceles triangle where the altitude from the apex bisects the base, yielding two right triangles with legs a and 8 and hypotenuse 10, leading to a=6 and base x=2a=12. However, the SVG labeling contradicts this: (1) The base AB is explicitly labeled “10” (not x), while x is labeled along side AC; the feedback treats x as the base length. (2) A length “10” is also labeled along side BC, suggesting BC=10; if AC and BC were the equal legs of an isosceles triangle, the base should be x, not 10. (3) The length “8” is drawn as a perpendicular from vertex B to side AC (with a right-angle marker at the foot), not as an altitude from the apex (vertex C) to the base as used in the feedback’s derivation. Thus the diagram’s geometry and labels (base=10, BC=10, x on AC, 8 from B to AC) do not match the textual explanation and the calculation that x (the base) equals 12. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the item’s text and feedback.
- nice_x3e8518fc8fe1164c_38246 -> The main diagram shows quadrilateral ABCD (solid) and its image A'B'C'D' (dashed) reflected across a vertical line. Reading coordinates from the axes: A is at (2, 1) and A' at (-2, 1); B at (5, 2) and B' at (-5, 2); C at (4, 5) and C' at (-4, 5); D at (1, 3) and D' at (-1, 3). In each case, the midpoint of corresponding x-coordinates is 0, so the line of reflection is the vertical line x = 0 (the y-axis). The choice images confirm this: option B draws the vertical line at x = 0; option A draws x = 3; option C draws a diagonal line. The response-declaration correctly marks B as correct. However, the feedback text states the equation of the reflection line is x = -4, which contradicts the diagram and the correct option. Therefore, the item is inconsistent due to incorrect feedback MathML.
- nice_x9130aa247c7c7ceb_91913 -> Text/MathML states m∠ABD = 120°, m∠ABC = 7x + 5°, m∠CBD = 3x + 15°. The solution/feedback computes x = 10, hence m∠ABC = 75° and m∠CBD = 45°, with ∠ABC + ∠CBD = ∠ABD = 120°. The SVG, however, fixes the rays so that AB is horizontal left from B, BC is vertical up from B, and BD is down-right from B. This geometry implies: (1) ∠ABC is exactly a right angle (≈90°) between the horizontal and vertical rays, not 75°. The blue angle arc is drawn precisely between the left and up rays, visually a quarter-turn. (2) The angle between BC (up) and BD (to (340,260)) is approximately 112.7°, not 45°. (3) The angle between BA (left) and BD is approximately 157°, not 120°. Thus the diagram’s actual angular relationships contradict the given measures and the computed result, even though the arcs qualitatively suggest angle addition. Therefore, the diagram is not consistent with the item’s numeric information.
- nice_x14930323e5d6bbed_80031 -> The item text asks for the height h of a triangular prism, stating that every vertical slice is an isosceles triangle. The feedback/explanation relies on specific numeric values: an isosceles triangle with base 8 (half-base 4) and equal sides 5, leading to h = sqrt(5^2 − 4^2) = 3. However, the SVG diagram contains no numeric labels or dimensions indicating 8, 4, or 5. The only visible label is “h,” and while a dashed isosceles triangle is depicted, no measurements are provided to support the calculations used in the feedback. Thus, the diagram does not present the numerical information referenced in the solution, making the item under-specified and inconsistent with the textual/feedback details used to compute the answer.
- nice_xd6065711fef935d1_58681 -> The item asks for x in an isosceles triangle and the feedback asserts that dropping an altitude and using the Pythagorean Theorem gives x = 4 (choice A). The SVG shows an altitude (dashed) from vertex A to side BC with a right-angle marker at the foot and the label x along this altitude. The sides are numerically labeled AB = 5 (text at the base), AC = 5 (text along the left side), and BC = 6 (text along the right side). For this isosceles triangle (AB = AC = 5, BC = 6), the altitude from A to BC would indeed be x = sqrt(5^2 − (6/2)^2) = sqrt(25 − 9) = 4, matching the keyed answer and the feedback method. However, the same SVG also displays angle measures: ∠A = 40°, ∠B = 70°, and ∠C = 70°. These angles are inconsistent with the side lengths 5, 5, and 6. For a 5–5–6 isosceles triangle, ∠A (opposite side BC = 6) would be approximately 73.74°, and the base angles at B and C would be approximately 53.13°, not 70°. Thus, the diagram contains contradictory information (angles vs. side lengths). While the side-lengths and altitude depiction are consistent with the feedback and correct answer x = 4, the angle labels contradict that same configuration. Because the SVG’s visual data are internally inconsistent, the item’s diagram is not fully consistent with the mathematical information used to justify the correct answer.
- nice_x014b6ef7252c3176_99934 -> The item asks for the image of point R after a 270° clockwise rotation about the center. In the SVG, R is on the right (east) from the center (line from (200,200) to (380,200)). A 270° clockwise rotation from east lands at the top (north), which in the SVG is the line from (200,200) to (200,20), labeled A. However, the declared correct response in the XML is D, which is at the bottom (south), corresponding to a 90° clockwise rotation, not 270°. Furthermore, the inline feedback statements conflict with the diagram: A is described as 90° clockwise (but is at 270° clockwise), B is described as 45° clockwise (but is at 45° counterclockwise), and C is described as 315° clockwise (but is at 45° clockwise). The general feedback about 270° being three-quarters of a revolution is correct, but the choice key and inline feedback are inconsistent with the diagram.
- nice_x8d9bf2e7361a83d4_18566 -> The item text and feedback state that the figure is a right triangle with a square on each side, and that the area of the largest square (on the hypotenuse) is 85. The correct options are those whose two areas sum to 85 (B: 25+60 and C: 36+49), which matches the Pythagorean theorem requirement a^2 + b^2 = c^2. However, the SVG depicts a specific right triangle with equal legs: both leg-attached squares are drawn with identical dimensions (each rect has width=height=126.666...), while the hypotenuse-attached square is larger and rotated. This visually implies an isosceles right triangle, so the two smaller squares must have equal areas. For an 85-area hypotenuse square, that would force each smaller square’s area to be 42.5, not two unequal integers as in options B or C. Thus the diagram’s specific geometry (equal leg squares) contradicts the answer logic that accepts any unequal pair summing to 85. Therefore, the visual information is inconsistent with the textual/answer information.
- nice_x833c60d66f358573_86138 -> The item text defines ∠A = 7x + 16° and ∠B = 5x − 28°, asks for the measure of ∠A, and the scoring expects 128°. That result requires A and B to be supplementary (7x+16 + 5x−28 = 180 → x = 16 → ∠A = 128°, ∠B = 52°). The feedback also describes using a linear pair and corresponding angles to relate A and B via 180°. However, the SVG diagram shows two parallel horizontal lines cut by a transversal, with angle A marked at the lower intersection above the lower line on the left of the transversal, and angle B marked at the upper intersection below the upper line on the right of the transversal. These are alternate interior angles and are drawn as congruent obtuse angles (both arcs depict the same obtuse wedge, approximately 113°), implying ∠A = ∠B, not ∠A + ∠B = 180°. Therefore, the visual relationships in the diagram contradict the algebraic relationships and the expected numeric answer.
- nice_xba87e92ab1a41f32_46924 -> Parsing the item: The prompt asks what error Marisol made after concluding ΔABC cannot be mapped onto ΔFED by rigid motions. The choices include that a reflection would map ΔABC onto ΔFED (choice B, marked correct). The SVG shows two triangles on a coordinate grid: A(2,2), B(4,−2), C(1,−2) and F(−2,2), E(−4,−2), D(−1,−2). From the diagram, ΔFED is exactly the reflection of ΔABC across the y‑axis (x=0): (2,2)→(−2,2), (4,−2)→(−4,−2), (1,−2)→(−1,−2). Thus the item’s correct key and the main prompt/choice text are consistent with the diagram. However, the “INCORRECT” feedback block states: “After rotating ΔABC about point C, a reflection across a vertical line through the midpoint of segment DE completes the mapping onto ΔFED.” In the diagram, point C is at (1,−2). Any rotation about C leaves C at (1,−2). The midpoint of DE is ( (−4+−1)/2, (−2+−2)/2 ) = (−2.5, −2); the vertical reflection line is x=−2.5. Reflecting C across x=−2.5 sends x=1 to x′=2(−2.5)−1=−6, giving (−6,−2), which is not any of F(−2,2), E(−4,−2), or D(−1,−2). Therefore the described two‑step transformation cannot map ΔABC onto ΔFED as drawn. The only vertical line that maps C(1,−2) to D(−1,−2) is x=0 (the y‑axis), and no preliminary rotation about C preserves C’s location to then achieve that via x=−2.5. Hence this feedback text contradicts the diagram. All other elements (labels, coordinates, and the correctness of reflection in choice B) are consistent.
- nice_x5602983628fe349f_42263 -> The item text asks for the value of x in a diagram of two parallel lines cut by a transversal. The response is constrained to an integer with the correct response set to 53, and the feedback asserts x = 53°. However, the provided SVG shows two horizontal parallel lines and one diagonal transversal with two angle arcs (one near the upper intersection and one near the lower-right intersection) and a label “x” near the lower-right angle, but there is no numeric angle label anywhere in the diagram. Without a given angle measure, x cannot be uniquely determined from the diagram and the stated facts about parallel lines alone. Furthermore, if one infers a measure from the actual coordinates of the transversal in the SVG (slope 7/6), the acute angle between the transversal and the horizontal is approximately 49.4°, not 53°, which also contradicts the keyed answer. Therefore, the visual information does not support or match the textual/feedback claim that x = 53°.
- nice_x1ecf301bf3e57e34_74908 -> The item asks whether the triangle is right using the areas on the attached squares. The SVG shows three squares labeled 25 (on side a), 49 (on side b), and 81 (on side c), and the feedback uses these exact values to conclude a^2 + b^2 = 25 + 49 = 74 ≠ 81 = c^2, so the triangle is not right. However, the SVG also explicitly depicts the triangle as a right triangle: there is a right-angle marker at the vertex (a small square) and the triangle drawn by points (160,280)-(260,280)-(260,140) is a right triangle. Moreover, the squares appear attached to the legs (100 and 140 units) and the hypotenuse (~172 units), so the drawn geometry is consistent with a right angle, but inconsistent with the numeric labels (since 25 + 49 ≠ 81). Thus, the visual right-angle indicator contradicts the textual/MathML conclusion and the correct answer key (B: not right). This inconsistency directly affects the single choice interaction that asks to decide if the triangle is right.
- nice_x7d460736291779f9_44082 -> The item asks to solve for x in an isosceles triangle and declares the correct answer as 61. The feedback reasoning states: because the triangle is isosceles, the base angles are equal and x + x + 58° = 180°, giving x = 61°. This logic requires the 58° to be the vertex (apex) angle, with both base angles equal to x. However, the SVG shows a triangle labeled A (left base), B (right base), and C (top apex). The 58° label is drawn at vertex A (left base), the x label is drawn at vertex B (right base), and the apex C has an unlabeled green arc. Thus, the diagram indicates angle A = 58° and angle B = x, implying the two base angles are A and B. For an isosceles triangle with apex at C (the usual interpretation), angles A and B should be equal; this would force x = 58°, not 61. Conversely, if the apex C were 58°, then the diagram should place the 58° at C, not at A. Therefore, the diagram’s labels contradict the textual/feedback calculation and the declared correct response. Conclusion: The diagram labeling (58° at a base angle) is inconsistent with the feedback equation (58° at the vertex) and the correct answer 61.
- nice_xb7add968d51ed18b_21914 -> Parsed from the SVG, EFGH is the 2×2 square with vertices F(0,0), E(2,0), H(2,2), G(0,2); ABCD is the 2×2 square with vertices C(4,3), D(4,5), A(6,5), B(6,3). Thus the figures are congruent. Vector HD = D − H = (4−2, 5−2) = (2,3). Evaluating the stated sequences: (1) Sequence A as written: a 90° clockwise rotation about H, then translate by vector HD. Rotating E(2,0) about H(2,2) by 90° clockwise sends E to (0,2); translating by (2,3) sends it to (2,5). The image of the square under this sequence has vertices {(2,5), (2,7), (4,7), (4,5)}, which does not match ABCD {(4,3), (4,5), (6,3), (6,5)}. However, if the rotation about H is 90° counterclockwise (not clockwise), then E→A, F→B, G→C, H→D exactly, and the figure maps onto ABCD. (2) Sequence B does not map EFGH to ABCD for either rotation sense about F followed by translation along FA. The item’s correct response and feedback assert that Sequence A maps EFGH onto ABCD, but the text of Sequence A specifies a clockwise rotation; the diagram and coordinates require a counterclockwise rotation. Therefore the diagram and the textual description are inconsistent.
- nice_xc6bf0f0120880555_34441 -> Text/MathML states ∠LON is straight and gives m∠LOM = 4x − 18°, m∠MON = 6x + 78°. The worked solution finds x = 12, yielding m∠LOM = 30° and m∠MON = 150° (obtuse). In the SVG, L, O, N are collinear horizontally (L at left, N at right), and M lies above-right of O (approximately 63° above the positive x-axis). Therefore the geometric angle ∠MON (between OM and ON to the right) is the smaller, acute angle (~63°), not an obtuse 150°. The drawn arcs reinforce this: the arc from OM to N (green) is the small angle, while the arc from L to OM (blue) is the larger one. This contradicts the textual assignment that ∠MON is the larger (150°). Hence the diagram does not match the text/solution.
- nice_x51185452f9f3d505_14563 -> The textual/MathML givens state PQ ⟂ PS, m∠QPR = 6x − 8°, and m∠RPS = 4x + 18°, leading to complementary angles that sum to 90°. The worked feedback solves to x = 8 and concludes m∠QPR = 40° and m∠RPS = 50°. The SVG correctly shows PQ vertical, PS horizontal, and a right-angle box at P, consistent with PQ ⟂ PS. However, the ray PR is drawn from P(220,220) to R(300,140), giving Δx = 80 and Δy = −80, i.e., a 45° direction that bisects the right angle at P. The blue angle arc for ∠QPR is drawn from the vertical toward the 45° direction (endpoint near (253.94,186.06), which is at a 45° bearing from P), visually indicating ∠QPR ≈ 45°. This contradicts the algebraic result and the keyed answer (40°). Therefore, the diagram implies ∠QPR ≈ 45° while the item text/solution requires 40°, making the item diagram-text combination inconsistent.
- nice_x1b31c01db3d60888_68864 -> The item asks for the length x in a right triangle. The SVG depicts triangle ABC with a right angle at B (explicitly labeled 90°), side AB labeled 8, side BC labeled 11, and the hypotenuse AC labeled x. The feedback/math uses the Pythagorean theorem with legs 8 and 11 to derive x = sqrt(185), which is consistent with those side labels and the right angle at B. However, the diagram also includes an additional angle marking of 40° at vertex A. For a right triangle with legs 8 (adjacent to angle A) and 11 (opposite to angle A), angle A should be arctan(11/8) ≈ 54.5°, not 40°. Thus, the diagram contains conflicting information: the 40° label is inconsistent with the given side lengths (8 and 11) and the right-triangle configuration used in the text and feedback. While the correct answer and feedback are internally consistent with the side labels, the presence of the incorrect 40° marking makes the overall item visually/textually inconsistent.
- nice_x373b3c865fedf846_10911 -> The item asks for the area of the right trapezoid. The SVG shows a right trapezoid with: a dashed vertical left side marked x (height), a right-angle marker at the bottom-left corner, the slanted right side labeled 5, and the top horizontal base labeled 4 (the 4 is centered above the entire top base segment). In the feedback, the solution uses the Pythagorean relation 4^2 + x^2 = 5^2 to infer x = 3, then computes areas 4×3 for the rectangle and (1/2)×3×4 for the right triangle, summing to 18. The inconsistency is that the diagram labels 4 on the top base and 5 on the right slanted side, while x labels the left vertical height. As drawn, these three labeled segments do not form a single right triangle: the leg labeled 4 (top base) meets the leg labeled x (left height) at the top-left corner, but the hypotenuse labeled 5 is the right non-parallel side from the top-right to bottom-right, not the diagonal connecting the endpoints of the 4 and x legs. The right triangle that actually has hypotenuse 5 in the trapezoid decomposition is the triangular piece on the right, whose horizontal leg equals the difference of the bases; that horizontal leg is not labeled in the diagram. Therefore, the step 4^2 + x^2 = 5^2 is not supported by the diagram as labeled. While the numeric answer 18 matches the computations provided, the mapping of the labeled lengths to the right triangle used in the Pythagorean step is inconsistent with the SVG labeling.
- nice_x604c7c450eb40990_37722 -> Parsing the item: The prompt states a dilation centered at P with scale factor 4/3. The choices and feedback assert that with k = 4/3 > 1 the image △A′B′C′ is larger and that distances from P to image points are 4/3 times those to preimage points, and that image points lie on the ray from P through the corresponding preimage points. Diagram analysis: The grid uses 40 px per unit with P at (200,200) representing (0,0). Original vertices are A(1,1)→(240,160), B(3,1)→(320,160), C(2,3)→(280,80). Image vertices with k = 4/3 are A′(4/3,4/3)→(253.33,146.67), B′(4,4/3)→(360,146.67), C′(8/3,4)→(306.67,40). These positions and the distance annotations (e.g., PA = √2, PA′ = (4/3)√2) correctly reflect the 4/3 dilation. However, the dashed “dilation rays” intended to show rays from P through corresponding vertices are inconsistent for vertex B: the dashed line is drawn from P(200,200) to (400,120), which has slope −0.4 and does not pass through B(320,160) or B′(360,146.67), whose line from P has slope −1/3. Thus the diagram’s ray for B contradicts the textual/feedback statement that image points lie on the ray from P through the corresponding preimage vertex. Aside from this misdrawn ray, coordinates and scale factor relationships are consistent. Because the visual ray information conflicts with the text/feedback property, the item is considered inconsistent.
- nice_xfa3483a19f2475a8_82128 -> Parsed item: Triangle ABC with base AB horizontal, apex C above; an auxiliary point D lies on the extension of AC beyond C. The SVG shows angle labels: 58° at B (blue, interior), 123° at A (red), and x at C (green). The feedback solution uses the 123° as an exterior angle at A, stating ∠DAB and ∠BAC form a linear pair, hence ∠BAC = 180° − 123° = 57°, and then 58° + 57° + x = 180° ⇒ x = 65°. In the diagram, however: (1) The red arc labeled 123° at A is drawn on the small interior wedge between AB and AC (i.e., the interior angle), not the exterior angle adjacent to it. Given the geometry, that interior angle is acute (~57°), not 123°. (2) The point D is on the same ray as AC from A (A–C–D are collinear in that order), so ∠DAB and ∠BAC coincide rather than forming a linear pair; the statement in the feedback about those angles being a linear pair does not match the diagram. While the numeric answer 65° matches the intended calculation, the visual labeling and the angle-naming relationship are inconsistent with the text/feedback.
- nice_xa7b00dbf617b9115_79792 -> The main stem diagram (SVG 1) places triangle ABC at A(2,3), B(5,4), C(4,2) and A′B′C′ at A′(2,−3), B′(5,−4), C′(4,−2). Corresponding points share the same x-values and have opposite y-values, so their midpoints lie at y=0; thus the line of reflection is the x-axis, y=0. The choice images show horizontal lines at y=0 (SVG 2), y=1 (SVG 3), and y=2 (SVG 4). However, the response key marks choice B as correct, which corresponds to y=1, and the feedback explicitly states “The line of reflection is y=1” and gives midpoints (2,1) and (5,1). These are inconsistent with the stem diagram, which clearly indicates the mirror line is y=0 with midpoints at (2,0) and (5,0). Therefore, the diagram contradicts the declared correct answer and feedback.
- nice_xcec43f941acb19f1_42798 -> The item asks for x in a right triangle and the feedback computes x using the Pythagorean Theorem with side lengths a = x (base), b = 2.5 (vertical leg), and c = 6.5 (hypotenuse), yielding x = 6, which matches the correct choice D. The SVG diagram supports these side labels: AB is labeled x, AC is labeled 2.5, BC is labeled 6.5, and the right angle at A is marked 90°. However, the diagram also labels the acute angles as 35° at B and 55° at C. Those angle measures are inconsistent with the given side lengths 2.5 and 6.5 in a right triangle: if c = 6.5 and one leg is 2.5, the acute angles should be approximately 22.6° and 67.4° (since sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse = 2.5/6.5 ≈ 0.3846), not 35° and 55°. Thus, while the side labels and feedback are mutually consistent, the angle labels in the SVG contradict the side lengths, making the overall diagram inconsistent with the textual/mathematical information used to solve the problem.
- nice_xaf090d34b6931448_47572 -> Parsed item text and MathML: ∠A = 7x − 8°, ∠B = 5x + 32°. Prompt: use alternate exterior angles to solve for x and then find ∠A. Feedback sets ∠A = ∠B, solves 7x − 8 = 5x + 32 → x = 20, then ∠A = 132°, and the scoring expects 132. The SVG shows two parallel horizontal lines (y≈110 and y≈250) cut by a transversal from (270,35) to (130,325). Angle markers (arcs) and labels indicate: – ∠A is drawn at the top intersection on the exterior above the top line on the right side of the transversal; – ∠B is drawn at the bottom intersection on the exterior below the bottom line on the left side of the transversal. These are indeed alternate exterior positions. However, both arcs drawn are acute (the arc for ∠A spans roughly the small angle between the rightward horizontal ray and the up-right segment of the transversal, ≈60°; similarly for ∠B). The feedback/result asserts ∠A = 132°, an obtuse angle. Since the SVG explicitly depicts the acute versions of the alternate exterior angles with small arcs, this contradicts the computed/expected obtuse measure of 132°. Therefore, the diagram is not consistent with the textual/MathML solution and expected answer.
- nice_x0639eaa9ca9a1b34_63178 -> The item text and feedback specify a right triangle with legs 9 and 5 and ask for the hypotenuse x, leading to x = sqrt(106). The SVG diagram labels the base AB as 9 and the vertical leg BC as 5, and marks x on the hypotenuse AC, which aligns with the feedback’s Pythagorean setup. However, the same SVG also labels the acute angles as 50° at A and 40° at C. With legs 9 (adjacent to angle A) and 5 (opposite angle A), angle A should be arctan(5/9) ≈ 29°, and angle C should be ≈ 61°, not 50° and 40°. Thus, the angle measures in the diagram contradict the numerical side lengths used in the item and feedback, creating an inconsistency.
- nice_xa169a7cc1c672cca_38653 -> Parsed item-body: The problem defines ∠A = 6x + 24° and ∠B = 2x + 88°, shows a diagram of two parallel horizontal lines cut by a transversal, labels the angles A and B at the intersections, and instructs to solve for x and then find the measure of ∠A. The feedback sets 6x + 24 = 2x + 88, yielding x = 16 and ∠A = 120°. Diagram analysis: The SVG shows two horizontal lines at y=140 and y=260, with a slanted transversal from (140,20)→(220,140)→(300,260)→(380,380). Angle arcs are drawn at the upper intersection near (220,140) and the lower intersection near (300,260), and labeled A and B respectively. In both cases, the arcs are drawn on the lower-right side of each intersection between the rightward horizontal ray and the down-right segment of the transversal. Given the slope of the transversal (Δx≈80, Δy≈120), these marked angles are acute (about 56°), i.e., the smaller angle between the line and the transversal. Consistency check: The algebra and feedback yield ∠A = 120° (obtuse), but the SVG explicitly marks A (and B) with small acute angle arcs. There are no indications that the arcs represent the obtuse angles (no large obtuse arc is drawn). Thus, the visual depiction of A and B as acute angles contradicts the computed measure of 120°. While the notion of corresponding angles being equal matches the diagram setup, the specific angle magnitude implied by the drawn arcs is inconsistent with the textual/MathML solution.
- nice_x7329a7c997cf0ce3_62298 -> The SVG shows two parallel horizontal lines cut by a single diagonal transversal. Angle arcs are drawn in the lower-right quadrant at both intersections: one near the top line labeled A (blue arc), and one near the bottom line labeled B (red arc). These marked positions depict A and B as corresponding acute angles (the small angle between the rightward horizontal ray and the down-right transversal ray at each intersection). Therefore, the diagram indicates A = B by the corresponding angles postulate. However, the item’s solution and correct response assume A and B are supplementary, using (7x+28) + (3x+32) = 180 to obtain x = 12 and ∠B = 68°. This conflicts with the diagram: if A and B are corresponding as drawn, then 7x+28 = 3x+32 ⇒ x = 1 and ∠B = 35°, not 68°. Hence, the visual relationships in the SVG contradict the text/solution provided.
- nice_x0b11e95bdab3f1f4_53415 -> The item text and feedback state that the two marked angles are corresponding and therefore congruent. In the SVG, the same corner (lower-right) angle at each intersection is highlighted with red arcs. The bottom intersection’s marked angle is explicitly labeled 47°, and the top intersection’s corresponding marked angle is labeled x. Therefore x should equal 47°. However, the response declaration and the feedback claim the correct value is 52°. This contradicts the diagram’s 47° label for the corresponding angle and the stated property that corresponding angles are equal.
- nice_x21a96f05c226ebc8_72754 -> Parsed text/MathML: ∠A = 7x + 20°, ∠B = 3x + 84°. Feedback asserts A and B are alternate interior angles on parallel lines, so A = B ⇒ x = 16, giving ∠B = 132°. The SVG shows two clearly parallel horizontal lines (y=120 and y=280) cut by a transversal from (100,40) to (420,360) with slope 1 (a 45° line). The marked angles with arcs are at the top-right interior (near (180,120)) labeled A and the bottom-left interior (near (340,280)) labeled B. Given the transversal’s 45° inclination, these particular interior angles are acute (~45°) in the drawing. The arcs themselves are drawn between the horizontal and the diagonal on the acute side at both intersections, reinforcing that the marked angles are acute. This visually conflicts with the computed answer ∠B = 132° (obtuse) provided by the item’s solution and correct response. While the equality relationship (alternate interior angles) is consistent, the magnitude implied by the diagram (acute angles) contradicts the provided numerical result (132°). Therefore, the diagram and the text/solution are inconsistent.
- nice_x42af57ec523a07d4_39561 -> Parsed prompt: ΔA'B'C' is obtained from ΔABC by a dilation centered at P with scale factor 1/3. The main diagram (SVG 1) correctly shows ABC (solid) and A'B'C' (dashed) with P at (40, 225.45). The coordinates verify a 1/3 dilation from P: e.g., A'=(132.73,184.24)=P+(1/3)(A−P), and similarly for B' and C'. Choice diagrams: A (SVG 2) shows a dilation ≈0.7 from P; B (SVG 3) shows the correct 1/3 dilation from P; C (SVG 4) and D (SVG 5) use different centers and/or larger scale factors. Thus, mathematically, B is the only choice matching a 1/3 dilation about P. However, the item’s prompt asks: “Which diagram shows ΔA'B'C' as the solid figure?” In all choice diagrams (A–D), the primed triangle A'B'C' is drawn with a dashed green stroke (and labeled A', B', C'), while the unprimed triangle ABC is the solid dark-stroked polygon. There is no choice where A'B'C' is the solid-lined figure. The keyed correct response B matches the intended scale and center, but it still depicts A'B'C' as dashed, not solid, contradicting the prompt’s requirement. Therefore, the visual information in the choices is inconsistent with the textual instruction (“as the solid figure”).
- nice_x297abd97564f5023_32953 -> The SVG shows ABCD (solid) rotated to A'B'C'D' (dashed) about the labeled point P at (159,105). Computing vectors from P confirms a 90° counterclockwise rotation: for example, A(278,224) − P(159,105) = (119,119); rotating 90° CCW gives (−119,119), which added to P yields A'(40,224), matching the SVG. Similar checks for B, C, and D also match a 90° CCW rotation (equivalently 270° CW). However, the item’s correct-response declares A and E (90° clockwise and 270° counterclockwise), which correspond to the opposite pair. The feedback also asserts that 270° counterclockwise and 90° clockwise describe the rotation, contradicting the diagram’s 90° counterclockwise rotation. Additionally, the stem says rotation is about point Q, while the diagram labels the center as P, creating a naming mismatch. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the declared correct answers and the text.
- nice_xc0c504fedb55ca58_59008 -> The mathematical content and coordinates are internally consistent: choice B’s dashed triangle exactly matches a dilation of ABC about P=(256.3636,210) with scale factor 1/4 (A'=(202.2727,171.3636), B'=(233.1818,248.6364), C'=(287.2727,179.0909)). Choice A shows k=0.8 about P, and choices C and D use center A with k=1/4 and k=0.8 respectively; these match the inline feedback. The correct-response key (B) is therefore mathematically consistent. However, the prompt states “Which figure shows triangle A'B'C' (solid) …” while in every choice SVG the image triangle A'B'C' is drawn with a dashed stroke (stroke-dasharray="4 4") and the original ABC is the solid-stroked polygon. This text–diagram mismatch about the line style of A'B'C' is a contradiction affecting the interaction prompt.
- nice_x3e817b460991138e_32495 -> The text states: “Riverton is 15 kilometers west of Midvale, and Oakridge is 17 kilometers north of Midvale.” The SVG labels the triangle’s vertices as M, R, and O with coordinates approximately M at (41.3,380), R at (358.7,380), and O at (41.3,20). This places R to the right (east) of M and O above (north of) M. Thus, the diagram shows Riverton east of Midvale, contradicting the prompt’s statement that Riverton is west of Midvale. The Oakridge placement (north of Midvale) is consistent. The numerical calculation and feedback (hypotenuse ≈ sqrt(15^2+17^2) = 22.7) are consistent with the text, but the directional inconsistency between the diagram and the text remains.
- nice_x29dcf6e74b01b609_69913 -> Parsed item: Given m∠LON is a straight angle, with m∠LOM = 5x + 13° and m∠MON = 4x + 14°, find m∠LOM. The solution in feedback sums to 180°, solves x = 17, yielding m∠LOM = 98° and m∠MON = 82°. Diagram analysis: The SVG shows L–O–N as a horizontal straight line (left to right) and M directly above O with a vertical ray OM. Arcs labeled θ (between OL and OM) and φ (between OM and ON) run exactly from the left horizontal to the vertical up, and from vertical up to the right horizontal, respectively, depicting two right angles (each 90°). Thus, visually ∠LOM = 90° and ∠MON = 90°, which contradicts the textual/algebraic measures 98° and 82°, even though their sum is 180°. No indication is given that the diagram is not to scale or that OM is not perpendicular; the drawn geometry implies perpendicularity. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the numeric result required by the item and its feedback.
- nice_x0704224416f3c369_87022 -> The item asks for the length of x in an isosceles triangle. The feedback asserts that drawing the altitude to the base creates two right triangles with legs 4 and 5, leading to x^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 = 41 and the correct answer x = √41 (choice B). However, the SVG shows a different set of dimensions: the dashed segment from vertex A to the midpoint of side BC is labeled 5 (the altitude), and the segment from that midpoint to vertex B along side BC is labeled 8 (half of the base BC). The angle markers 50°–80°–50° confirm the triangle is isosceles with equal sides AB and AC, both labeled x in the figure. Therefore, the right triangles formed by the altitude have legs 5 and 8, giving x^2 = 5^2 + 8^2 = 89 and x = √89 (choice C). This contradicts the provided correct response (choice B) and the feedback’s use of 4 instead of 8. Thus, the diagram and the textual/math information are inconsistent.
- nice_xfca089f1f1675363_18932 -> The main SVG shows a trapezoid with vertices at (-8,1), (-6,3), (-2,3), (2,1) and its image at (-8,-1), (-6,-3), (-2,-3), (2,-1). The connecting segments between corresponding points are vertical and have midpoints on y=0, so the reflection line is y=0 (the x-axis). The answer choices reflect this: choice B depicts the horizontal line at y=0, and the qti-correct-response is B. However, the CORRECT feedback text claims the midpoints are (-6,-3) and (2,-3) and concludes the mirror line is y = -3, which contradicts the diagram, the numeric midpoints, and the correct answer image. The INCORRECT feedback aligns with the diagram (noting the mirror line must be horizontal). Therefore, the item contains an inconsistency between the diagram/answer key and the CORRECT feedback explanation.
- nice_xedbe1fb4b2a09c59_36186 -> The SVG diagram depicts three rays PQ, PR, and PS from vertex P with labels Q, R, S correctly placed. An arc across the top between PQ and PS is explicitly labeled 56°, matching the given m∠QPS = 56°. The configuration visually supports that ∠QPR and ∠RPS are adjacent and sum to ∠QPS. However, the item’s mathematical setup and declared correct answer are inconsistent with this. From the given expressions, angle addition yields (6x − 20) + (4x − 12) = 56 ⇒ 10x − 32 = 56 ⇒ x = 8.8, so m∠QPR = 6x − 20 = 32.8°, not 28. The response declaration and feedback assert x = 8 and m∠QPR = 28°, which would pair with m∠RPS = 20° and sum to 48°, contradicting the 56° total shown in the diagram (and stated in the givens). Thus, while the diagram itself is consistent with the stated givens, it conflicts with the item’s provided solution path and expected answer.
- nice_x838e426d9487b28a_48203 -> The item asks: “Two parallel lines are cut by a transversal; use the diagram to determine x.” The response is a single integer with the correct answer set to 129°, and the feedback asserts x = 129° by using corresponding/vertical angles. SVG analysis: The diagram shows two horizontal, parallel lines (y≈120 and y≈240), a diagonal transversal passing through (200,120) and (280,240), a label “x” placed between the two lines near the right side, and two unlabeled angle arcs (one green near the upper intersection, one blue near the lower intersection). Crucially, there is no numeric angle measure anywhere in the diagram. Consistency check: - The text and feedback imply that a specific numeric angle should be read from the diagram (or that some given measure exists) to justify x = 129°. However, the SVG provides no numeric angle labels, so x cannot be determined from the diagram alone. - If one attempts to infer an angle from the drawn slopes, the angle between the transversal and the horizontal is approximately 53.13° (lower segment) or 56.31° (middle segment), giving obtuse supplements of about 126.87° or 123.69°, not 129°. Thus the drawn geometry does not support 129° either. Therefore, the diagram does not supply the information needed to conclude x = 129°, and the only numerical value provided in the item (129°) is not supported by the figure. This is an inconsistency affecting the sole interaction.
- nice_xec1766ed9f1a3185_61370 -> The item text defines the marked angles as ∠A = 3x + 31° and ∠B = 2x + 62°, and the feedback asserts they are alternate exterior angles, hence equal, leading to x = 31 and ∠B = 124°. The SVG shows two parallel horizontal lines (y=120 and y=280) cut by a transversal, with arcs marking angles labeled A (near the top-left intersection) and B (near the bottom-right intersection). However, the arcs drawn at both intersections are the smaller, acute angles (approximately the acute angle between the transversal and the horizontal, ~63°), as indicated by the small arc spans from the horizontal ray to the diagonal ray. If ∠B is 124°, the marked angle should be obtuse (the larger exterior angle), not the acute one drawn. Thus, the diagram’s marked angles (acute) conflict with the numerical result and feedback (obtuse 124°), creating a visual-text inconsistency.
- nice_x8669a2e8f4725f9e_82176 -> The item asks for x in the right triangle shown. The SVG clearly depicts a right angle at B (90°), with side labels placed as follows: AB (base) is labeled 9, BC (vertical) is labeled 15 (text rotated -90° along the vertical), and the slanted side AC is labeled x. Thus, in the diagram, the legs are 9 and 15 and the hypotenuse is x. By the Pythagorean theorem, that would imply x = sqrt(9^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(306). However, the provided feedback and declared correct answer treat 15 as the hypotenuse and x as a leg: the feedback states x^2 + 9^2 = 15^2, yielding x = 12, and the response-declaration marks choice B (x = 12) as correct. This directly contradicts the diagram labeling where 15 is a leg and x is the hypotenuse. Additionally, the angle annotations in the SVG show A = 37° and C = 53°, which align with a 9-12-15 triangle (hypotenuse 15), not with legs 9 and 15; thus the internal labels (9 on AB, 15 on BC, x on AC) also conflict with the angle markings. Therefore, the diagram and the textual/numerical information (feedback and correct response) are inconsistent.
- nice_xa543a1b5f3652216_33605 -> The SVG scatter plot shows Sleep (hours, last week) on the y-axis with tick marks from 40 to 62, and Social media time (hours, last week) on the x-axis from 0 to 14. The dashed trend line in the SVG runs approximately from (x=0, y≈60.5) to (x=14, y≈41.0), yielding a slope of about (41.0−60.5)/14 ≈ −1.39 hours of sleep per additional hour of social media, which is close to −4/3 and supports choice B. However, the feedback explanation cites example points (0, 23) and (12, 7) to justify the slope −4/3. These y-values (23 and 7 hours) are far outside the plotted y-axis range (40–62) and inconsistent with the plotted trend line’s intercept near 60. Thus, while the selected answer B aligns with the plotted trend, the feedback’s example coordinates contradict the diagram’s scale and content.
- nice_xcf809ac1b9e9f62a_97348 -> The main diagram shows quadrilateral ABCD with coordinates A(-7,1), B(-3,2), C(-4,6), D(-8,4) and its image A'(7,1), B'(3,2), C'(4,6), D'(8,4). This mapping is a reflection across the y-axis (x = 0). Choice B’s SVG explicitly draws the red reflection line at x = 0, matching the geometry; Choice A draws y = -1 and Choice C draws x = -4, both incorrect. The response key correctly sets the correct answer to B. However, the CORRECT feedback text states the line of reflection is y = 3, which contradicts the diagrams and the correct choice. Therefore, the item is inconsistent because the feedback’s MathML (y = 3) does not match the actual reflection line (x = 0) shown and implied by the diagrams and answer key.
- nice_xbc50b5a72210c4cc_18720 -> The item asks for the image △A′B′C′ resulting from dilating △ABC about center P with scale factor 2/3, and the response declaration marks only choice B as correct. However, analysis of the SVG options shows that both choices A and B depict valid dilations of △ABC by factor 2/3 about their respective labeled centers P. Details: - Stem: A dilation of △ABC about center P with k = 2/3. The common stem image shows only △ABC; it does not display a specific center P, so P is not fixed by the stem. - Choice B (SVG 3): P = (222.85714, 177.14286). Using A = (40, 62.85714), A′ drawn at (100.95238, 100.95238). Compute P + (2/3)(A − P) = (100.95238, 100.95238), matching the drawing. Similar checks for B and C also match, so B is a correct 2/3 dilation. - Choice A (SVG 2): P = (131.42857, 268.57143). Using the same A, A′ drawn at (70.47619, 131.42857). Compute P + (2/3)(A − P) = (70.47619, 131.42857), matching the drawing. B′ and C′ likewise match. Therefore A is also a correct 2/3 dilation about its shown center P. - Choice C (SVG 4) shows an enlargement (effectively 3/2), and choice D (SVG 5) shows a reflection; both are incorrect. Because the stem does not specify the location of P, more than one choice (A and B) satisfies a 2/3 dilation about a center P, yet the item marks only B as correct. This creates a contradiction: multiple valid answers for a single-choice interaction.
- nice_x7c21d72947ab7913_58497 -> The SVG shows a right triangle with side labels AB = 7 (base), BC = x (vertical), and hypotenuse AC = 10. This matches the prompt and the feedback’s Pythagorean calculation x^2 = 10^2 − 7^2, yielding x = √51 (choice C). However, the same SVG also explicitly labels the angles as 40° at A, 50° at C, and 90° at B. Those angle measures are inconsistent with the given side lengths 7 and 10: if ∠A = 40°, then AB/AC should equal cos 40° ≈ 0.766, implying AB ≈ 7.66, not 7; likewise, if ∠C = 50°, then x/AC should equal cos 50° ≈ 0.643, implying x ≈ 6.43, not √51 ≈ 7.14. Therefore, the diagram contains contradictory information (angle measures versus side lengths), even though the textual solution and correct answer rely on the side lengths. This inconsistency affects the sole interaction where the student must select x.
- nice_x889f3d155d57ca53_83093 -> Parsed item: The prompt asks for the perimeter of quadrilateral A′B′C′D′ obtained by reflecting quadrilateral ABCD across line m. The feedback states reflections preserve side lengths and sums the labeled side lengths 18 + 27 + 33 + 40 = 118, which matches the declared correct response (118). Diagram analysis: The SVG shows a vertical red line labeled m at x=210 and a solid left polygon with vertices A(70,250), B(130,270), C(140,200), D(60,190) and side-length labels 18, 27, 33, 40 placed adjacent to the respective edges. A dashed green polygon on the right has points at (350,250), (290,270), (280,200), (360,190), which are exact reflections of A, B, C, D across x=210. Thus the geometry and numeric lengths are consistent with the text and feedback calculation of 118. However, there is a labeling inconsistency on the reflected polygon: the right-hand labels read A’, A’, C’, D’, i.e., the second label (at the reflected B point) incorrectly shows “A’” instead of “B’”. The item text explicitly refers to the reflected quadrilateral as A′B′C′D′, so the duplicate “A’” label and missing “B’” label in the SVG contradict the textual labeling. Conclusion: Numeric values and reflection are correct, but the SVG labeling is inconsistent with the item text.
- nice_xb929b06d9368a116_92838 -> Parsed item body: Given m∠AOC = 150°, m∠AOB = 8x + 18°, m∠BOC = 4x + 12°. Find m∠BOC. Feedback solves 8x+18 + 4x+12 = 150 → x = 10 → m∠BOC = 52°. The SVG shows three rays from O labeled A, B, C. The ray directions correspond (in standard polar angles) to approximately A at 165°, B at 75°, C at 15°. The colored wedges depict the adjacent angles AOB and BOC with measures 90° (165°→75°) and 60° (75°→15°) respectively, and the diagram text labels 150° for AOC (consistent with 165°→15°). Thus, while m∠AOC = 150° matches both text and diagram, the diagram visually represents m∠BOC as 60° and m∠AOB as 90°, which contradict the computed values from the item’s algebra (m∠BOC = 52°, m∠AOB = 98°). No “not to scale” note is present. Therefore, the diagram and the numeric result required by the interaction are inconsistent.
- nice_x466801060b13ca44_68517 -> Parsing the item: The prompt asks whether Ravi’s conclusion about mapping quadrilaterals ABCD and EFGH by rigid motions is correct. The scoring key marks choice C (There is no error) as correct. The SVG shows ABCD with vertices A(138.72,227), B(204.04,176), C(236.70,227), D(187.71,278) and EFGH with E(89.73,235.5), F(187.71,159), G(236.70,235.5), H(163.215,312), plotted on a coordinate grid with axes at x=236.70 and y=210. Converting pixel coordinates to coordinate units using the grid scales (x-units ≈ 16.33 px per unit, y-units = 17 px per unit) and the axes, we obtain: - ABCD: A(-6,-1), B(-2,2), C(0,-1), D(-3,-4) - EFGH: E(-9,-1.5), F(-3,3), G(0,-1.5), H(-4.5,-6) EFGH is exactly a dilation of ABCD by a factor of 1.5 about the origin: (x,y) → 1.5(x,y). Thus, corresponding side lengths differ by a factor of 1.5 (e.g., |AB|=5 vs |EF|=7.5), while all corresponding angle measures are equal (dilations preserve angles). Therefore, Ravi’s conclusion that a rigid motion cannot map ABCD to EFGH (and they are not congruent) is correct, matching the keyed answer C. However, the CORRECT feedback text states that ABCD and EFGH have different side lengths and angle measures. The diagram implies equal corresponding angle measures (since one quadrilateral is a dilation of the other), not different angles. This is a contradiction between the diagram and the feedback text, even though the overall conclusion about non-congruence is correct. Hence, the item is not fully consistent with its diagram.
- nice_x4e0548d22e1822b2_54935 -> The item asks which graph represents y = -2x + 5 and declares choice B as correct. From the decoded SVGs: (A) shows a line from (x≈73.4,y≈440) to (x≈380,y≈-200), which has negative slope ≈ -2 (accounting for the grid scales of ~15.33 px per x-unit and 16 px per y-unit) and crosses the y-axis (x=226.7) near y≈120 px, corresponding to y≈5. Thus A matches y = -2x + 5. (B) shows a line from (73.4,-200) to (380,440), which has positive slope ≈ +2 and y-intercept ≈ 5 (i.e., y = 2x + 5), not matching the target equation. (C) has positive slope ≈ +2 with y-intercept ≈ -5 (y = 2x - 5). Therefore the graphic for A is the correct representation, but the QTI declares B as correct. This is a contradiction between the diagram content and the declared correct response/feedback.
- nice_xaf49e2024263ca6d_95565 -> The item asks for the vertical height h of a triangular prism and the feedback/explanation uses specific dimensions for a right triangle: leg 3 and hypotenuse 3√2, leading to h = 3. However, the SVG diagram contains no numerical labels or dimension markings other than the label h. There are no indications of a length 3 or a hypotenuse 3√2 in the diagram or in the stem text. Thus, the numerical information referenced in the solution is not present in the figure or item body, creating a mismatch between the visual content and the textual/mathematical explanation. While the scoring and rounding instruction are internally consistent (3 equals 3.0 as a float), the absence of the required dimensions in the diagram makes the visual content inconsistent with the feedback’s calculations.
- nice_x39e46aa87c1b0597_60821 -> The item text defines ∠A = 6x − 23° and ∠B = 3x + 41°. The SVG shows two horizontal (parallel) lines cut by a straight transversal. The angle arcs and labels place ∠A at the lower intersection in the interior top-left quadrant (between the leftward horizontal ray and the up-left transversal ray) and ∠B at the upper intersection in the interior bottom-right quadrant (between the rightward horizontal ray and the down-right transversal ray). These two labeled angles are alternate interior angles, which should be congruent when the lines are parallel. However, the provided solution and feedback treat them as forming a supplementary relationship: (6x − 23) + (3x + 41) = 180 ⇒ x = 18 ⇒ ∠A = 85°. This contradicts the diagram’s geometry. If the diagram’s labeled positions are honored (alternate interior), one would set 6x − 23 = 3x + 41, yielding x = 64/3 and ∠A = 105°, not 85°. The feedback text also states that the angle corresponding to ∠B equals the angle adjacent to ∠A; in the diagram, the angle corresponding to ∠B at the lower line is vertical to ∠A, not adjacent. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the text/solution and the declared correct response of 85°.
- nice_x8d38247844d64913_21766 -> The item text defines ∠A = 5x + 25° and ∠B = 2x + 88°, and the feedback asserts that, because the lines are parallel, ∠A and ∠B are corresponding angles and therefore congruent, leading to 5x+25 = 2x+88 and ∠A = 130°. However, the SVG shows two parallel horizontal lines (y=100 and y=260) cut by a single transversal from (220,100) to (320,260). The angle marker for A (blue arc) is drawn below the top line and to the right of the transversal, and it is acute (approx. 58°). The angle marker for B (orange arc) is drawn above the bottom line and to the right of the transversal, and it is obtuse (approx. 122°). These two marked angles are same-side interior (consecutive interior) angles, not corresponding; they should sum to 180°, not be equal. Consequently, the diagram implies 5x + 25 + 2x + 88 = 180, not 5x + 25 = 2x + 88. The provided solution and the expected answer ∠A = 130° contradict the visual information in the diagram.
- nice_xdf72a5a2b64e29b8_60077 -> The SVG shows a fitted blue trend line drawn from (x1=73.4 px, y1=356.376 px) to (x2=460 px, y2=57.234 px) across an axes frame where x=0..100 maps to 73.4..460 px (3.866 px/unit) and y=0..100 maps to 360..56.6 px (3.034 px/unit). Converting the line endpoints to data units gives approximately (0, 1.20) and (100, 99.83), so the fitted line in the diagram is about y ≈ 0.986x + 1.20, not exactly y = x. However, the item text and feedback assert that the fitted line has slope 1 and intercept 0, explicitly suggesting picking (0,0) and (100,100) as points on the line; these points are not exactly on the drawn line. While option D (ŷ = x) is indeed the closest of the provided choices, the feedback’s claim of an exact slope of 1 and intercept 0 contradicts the plotted trend line. The second part’s numeric prediction (x=88 → y≈88) still agrees with the drawn line to within rounding, but the exact-identity claim in the feedback is inconsistent with the SVG.
- nice_x3dda43dd251b3546_39442 -> The item asks for x with two parallel lines cut by a transversal. The correct response is 62, supported by feedback: take the angle adjacent to 118° on a straight line (180° − 118° = 62°) and then use parallel-line angle relationships to infer x = 62°. In the SVG, the top intersection shows an arc drawn for the acute angle below the top line and to the right of the transversal, but it is labeled “118°”. Geometrically, that location is the alternate interior partner of x (which is above the lower line and to the left of the transversal). If that interior angle at the top is 118°, then x should also be 118°, contradicting the stated answer and feedback. Furthermore, the arc geometry itself (endpoints of the arc relative to the intersection) represents an acute angle (about 70°) while the label says 118°, which is obtuse—another internal mismatch. To be consistent with the feedback and answer, the 118° label should be on the supplementary (exterior) angle adjacent to the small interior arc; the interior arc at the top should be 62°, matching x by alternate interior/corresponding relationships. As drawn, the diagram conflicts with the text/answer.
- nice_x6e938fda4e417bd2_91659 -> The item text and feedback specify a right triangle with vertical leg 60 m (hilltop height above valley floor) and horizontal leg 144 m (distance from base), and compute the hypotenuse as 156 m using c = sqrt(60^2 + 144^2). In the SVG, the right triangle has its horizontal base AB labeled “60” and the vertical leg AC labeled “144” (text elements show 60 centered along the horizontal side and 144 rotated along the vertical side). Thus, the diagram swaps the leg lengths compared to the text/MathML, creating a contradiction between the visual and the stated dimensions. The numerical answer and feedback are consistent with the text but not with the diagram’s labels.
- nice_x57c5d35e1304fc74_42260 -> Parsed item: The prompt asks, “Select the line that best fits the plotted data. Choose one answer.” Choices are A, B, C, and D (“None of the lines fit the data.”). The response declaration marks D as correct. The feedback further asserts, “None of the lines A, B, or C reasonably follow the overall trend of the plotted points.” SVG analysis: The scatterplot’s points show a strong increasing trend from left to right: Y rises from roughly ~1 at x≈1 to ~11.7 at x≈9 (e.g., cy values move from ~322 px toward ~85 px as x increases, consistent with higher numeric Y). Candidate lines are: - A (red): negative slope (from Y≈11 at x=0 to Y≈1 at x=10) — opposite the data trend. - B (green): horizontal at Y=6 — does not reflect the increasing trend. - C (blue): positive slope (from Y=2 at x=0 to Y=10 at x=10). While shallower than the data’s increase (data slope ≈1.3 Y-per-x vs. line C’s 0.8), it is the only line aligned with the overall upward trend and is clearly the best of A, B, and C in representing the trend direction. Consistency verdict: The diagram indicates that line C best represents the trend among the provided lines. However, the item encodes D (“None of the lines fit the data.”) as correct and the feedback reinforces that claim. This contradicts the visual evidence, since C reasonably follows the overall trend direction and is plainly the best of the three. Therefore, the correct-response and feedback are inconsistent with the SVG diagram.
- nice_x764e159b74ee28f2_19269 -> Parsed item text/math: OA̅ ⟂ OC̅, m∠AOB = 7x − 8°, m∠BOC = 2x + 8°. Since OA ⟂ OC, m∠AOC = 90° and adjacent angles add, so (7x − 8) + (2x + 8) = 90 ⇒ 9x = 90 ⇒ x = 10 ⇒ m∠AOB = 62° and m∠BOC = 28°; thus AOB > BOC. SVG analysis: Rays from O show OA to the right (east) and OC downward (south), with a right-angle marker—this matches OA ⟂ OC. Point B is on a ray between OA and OC at approximately 24–25° below OA (vector OB ≈ (110, 50)), so visually m∠AOB ≈ 25° and m∠BOC ≈ 65°, as also indicated by the two colored arcs: the small blue arc from A to B (AOB) and the larger green arc from B to C (BOC). These visual measures imply AOB < BOC, contradicting the textual/algebraic result where AOB = 62° and BOC = 28° (AOB > BOC). While diagrams need not be to scale, the explicit arc drawings convey relative sizes opposite to the computed values, creating a visual-text inconsistency. Therefore, the diagram’s placement of B and the arc extents are inconsistent with the mathematical relations and the correct response (62°).
- nice_x51b60bfce8805713_42272 -> The main diagram shows triangle ABC with coordinates symmetric about the y-axis: A at (-4, ~1.6) maps to A′ at (4, ~1.6); B at (-3, ~-0.8) maps to B′ at (3, ~-0.8); C at (-5, ~-0.8) maps to C′ at (5, ~-0.8). Thus, the correct line of reflection is the y-axis, i.e., x = 0. Among the answer choices, choice B draws the red dashed line at x = 0 (the y-axis), which matches the diagram, and the item’s correct-response key identifies B as correct. However, the CORRECT feedback explicitly states the reflection line is x = 1 (MathML: x=1), which contradicts the diagram and the correct choice. Therefore, the item content is internally inconsistent because the feedback’s numerical statement does not match the visual data and answer key.
- nice_xe676c8e5c9f458d4_70497 -> Parsed item: The prompt states Tammy mapped quadrilateral ABCD onto FGHE by a reflection followed by a translation, then concluded the figures are congruent. The SVG shows ABCD (solid) with vertices A(-6,1), B(-4,4), C(-1,3), D(-3,0) and FGHE (dashed) with vertices F(3,2), G(5,5), H(8,4), E(6,1), as read from the coordinate grid. The side vectors for ABCD are AB=(2,3), BC=(3,-1), CD=(-2,-3), DA=(-3,1); for FGHE they are FG=(2,3), GH=(3,-1), HE=(-2,-3), EF=(-3,1). Thus a pure translation by (9,1) maps ABCD exactly onto FGHE with the labeled correspondence A→F, B→G, C→H, D→E. The polygon orientation (shoelace) is the same (both clockwise), confirming the mapping is orientation-preserving. However, a reflection followed by a translation is an orientation-reversing isometry (a reflection or a glide reflection). Such a sequence cannot map ABCD to FGHE with the same labeled order A→F, B→G, C→H, D→E shown in the diagram. Therefore, the diagram contradicts the textual claim about the specific sequence of motions (reflection then translation), even though the ultimate conclusion that the figures are congruent is correct and consistent with the diagram. No numerical inconsistencies were found in axes or feedback text.
- nice_xca016de67c56c0c6_54360 -> The item text and feedback state that dropping the altitude from the apex of an isosceles triangle creates two right triangles with legs 3 and 4, so by the Pythagorean Theorem x = 5. The SVG supports the 3-4-5 setup in several ways: it marks the non-equal side AC with 6 (so each half is 3), shows a dashed altitude from the apex B to the midpoint of AC labeled 4, and labels the equal sides AB and BC as x. These data are consistent with x = 5 and the feedback. However, the SVG also explicitly labels the base angles at A and C as 50°. In a triangle with sides AB = BC = 5 and AC = 6 (or equivalently in the right triangle with legs 3 and 4), the base angles are approximately 53.13°, not 50° (e.g., cos(alpha) = 6/(2·5) = 0.6 ⇒ alpha ≈ 53.13°, or tan(alpha) = 4/3). Thus the angle measures shown in the diagram contradict the side/altitude lengths and the feedback’s 3-4-5 reasoning. Because the diagram contains inconsistent givens (50° angles vs. 6 and 4 lengths), the item is not fully consistent.
- nice_x3a864aa7fa5fe2df_87898 -> The item text and the SVG caption both state that quadrilateral OPQR was mapped to ONML by a reflection followed by a dilation. However, the plotted coordinates show the image ONML is obtained from OPQR by a pure dilation about O with scale factor 1.5, not involving a reflection. Using the grid/axis positions: O(-6,2), P(-3,5), Q(-2,1), R(-5,-1) and N(-1.5,6.5), M(0,0.5), L(-4.5,-2.5). Vectors from O scale by exactly 1.5: OP=(3,3) → ON=(4.5,4.5); OQ=(4,−1) → OM=(6,−1.5); OR=(1,−3) → OL=(1.5,−4.5). This preserves orientation (both polygons have the same oriented area sign), whereas a reflection would reverse orientation, and a subsequent dilation would leave that reversal intact. Therefore the diagram’s actual transform contradicts the stated use of a reflection. The scoring/feedback (that a sequence of rigid motions and a dilation implies similarity) is mathematically correct, but the depicted transformation sequence is not consistent with the text.
- nice_xebb03e004f3a0acb_90829 -> Parsing the item: The prompt asks for the length of x in the isosceles triangle shown. The declared correct choice is C (x = √40). The feedback explains dropping a perpendicular from the apex to the base, giving legs 2 and 6 so that x^2 = 2^2 + 6^2 = 40, hence x = √40. Analyzing the SVG: The triangle has vertices A (left base), B (right base), and C (top). The base AB is labeled with x, and the left side AC is also labeled x, implying the isosceles sides are AB and AC. A dashed line is drawn from A to side BC with a right-angle marker at its intersection, and this dashed segment is labeled 6. Along side BC, a segment is labeled 4 near the intersection region. There is no label 2 anywhere in the diagram. Moreover, the perpendicular shown is from A to BC, not from the apex (C) to the base (AB) as the feedback describes. Consistency check: Using the diagram’s indicated right triangle (perpendicular from A to BC), the legs are 6 (perpendicular) and 4 (along BC), making the hypotenuse x satisfy x^2 = 6^2 + 4^2 = 52, so x = √52 (which corresponds to choice D), not √40. The feedback’s computation (2 and 6) and description of the perpendicular (from apex to base) do not match the diagram. The response-declaration marking choice C as correct therefore contradicts the diagram, which supports choice D. Conclusion: The diagram is inconsistent with both the feedback text/numbers and the declared correct answer.
- nice_x7ddd0f82288e9ba2_99801 -> The item’s text presents 10 data pairs of commute time (minutes) vs. satisfaction rating (1–10) and states that each scatter plot represents the same data, with the convention that the explanatory variable (commute time) should be on the x-axis and both axes should use reasonable scales. Choices A, C, and D plot the same data points correctly (with A swapping axes, C using conventional axes with sensible full ranges, and D using tighter but still reasonable ranges). However, Choice B is internally inconsistent with the item’s stated scales: its y-axis is titled “Satisfaction rating (1 to 10)” but the tick labels are 10, 20, …, 100. Despite that labeling, the plotted y-positions of the points correspond to 1-step increments on a 1–10 scale (about 2.818 px per unit), not to a 0–100 scale (about 28.18 px per 10 units). For example, the two points for rating 9 are placed at y≈334.64, which is 0.9 of a 10-unit step above the baseline, indicating value 9 on a 1–10 scale, not 90 on a 0–100 scale. This contradicts both the axis title and the item statement that all plots represent the same data in a coherent way. Therefore, the item contains a diagram (choice B) whose axis labels are inconsistent with the stated 1–10 satisfaction scale and with how the points are actually plotted.
- nice_xff61e62b0b9cb446_69235 -> The diagram shows two quadrilaterals QRST (solid) and XYZW (dashed) whose corresponding side vectors and lengths are in a constant 1.5 ratio, indicating a dilation (similarity), not a rigid motion. For example: QR = 4 units while XY = 6 units; RS has vector (1,4) units while YZ is (1.5,6) units; ST (-4,1) vs ZW (-6,1.5); TQ (-1,-5) vs WX (-1.5,-7.5). Thus XYZW is exactly a 1.5-scale of QRST, so they are not congruent by rigid motions (consistent with the stem and the correct option C). However, the feedback states that their corresponding side lengths and angle measures differ. While side lengths differ, corresponding angle measures are preserved under dilation and therefore are equal in the diagram. This makes the feedback text inconsistent with the visual information.
- nice_x551d953eddab023b_22955 -> The diagram and numeric relationships largely agree: BC and DE are horizontal and parallel; the triangle ABC shows labeled angles 54° at B and 105° at A; computing ∠BCA gives 180° − 54° − 105° = 21°, and the small acute angle labeled x at A lies between AE (to the right) and AF (down-right along AC), i.e., ∠EAF, which by corresponding/alternate interior angles equals ∠BCA = 21°. However, the feedback text incorrectly states that ∠BCA corresponds to ∠DAF. In the figure, ∠x is drawn as ∠EAF, not ∠DAF. Moreover, ∠DAF would be the supplementary angle to ∠EAF (using AD to the left instead of AE to the right), i.e., 180° − 21° = 159°, not 21°. Thus the diagram’s labeling of x contradicts the named angle in the explanation, even though the final numeric answer 21° is correct.
- nice_xc2605058b1570c4d_59163 -> Parsed item asks to solve for hypotenuse x in the right triangle. Feedback and correct answer use Pythagorean theorem with legs 4 and 9, yielding x = √97 (choice A). The SVG shows a triangle with hypotenuse labeled x along base AB, side labels “4” on AC and “9” on BC, and a right-angle marker at vertex C (90°) — all consistent so far. However, the SVG also labels the acute angles at A and B as 40° and 50°, respectively. In a right triangle with legs 4 and 9 (AC = 4, BC = 9), angle A should satisfy tan(A) = opposite/adjacent = BC/AC = 9/4 ≈ 2.25, giving A ≈ 66.8°, and B ≈ 23.2°. These do not match the diagram’s 40° and 50°. Thus the visual contains contradictory information: the given side lengths (4 and 9) conflict with the given angle measures (40° and 50°), even though both are shown in the same diagram. While the numerical solution and feedback are internally consistent with 4 and 9, the SVG’s angle labels contradict those values, creating an inconsistency between the diagram and the item’s stated givens.
- nice_x2629e6f0882108f6_84257 -> The item text states the largest square has area 36 and asks which pairs could represent the areas of the two smaller squares. The feedback and correct responses (A and B) rely solely on the Pythagorean area relationship (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), accepting any pair that sums to 36. However, the provided SVG depicts a specific right triangle with equal legs: both leg-aligned squares are drawn with identical dimensions (each 120×120), and the right triangle’s legs are equal in length (120 units each), making it an isosceles right triangle. In that depicted triangle, the areas of the two smaller squares must be equal, so the only consistent pair would be 18 and 18 (summing to 36). The marked correct options (10 and 26) and (12 and 24) are unequal and therefore contradict the geometry shown in the diagram. Thus, the diagram is inconsistent with the scoring/feedback logic and answer key.
- nice_x6186a5e0a9e7cfba_55887 -> The item asks the test-taker to choose among “Line A”, “Line B”, and “Line C”, with choice D being “None of the lines represent the data.” The SVG shows three candidate lines (blue solid, red dashed, green solid) and a mini legend area on the right with three line samples, but the legend text labels are empty—there are no labels identifying which line is A, B, or C anywhere in the diagram. Therefore, the diagram does not provide the A/B/C mapping required by the textual choices. Aside from this labeling issue, the scatter points form a clear non-linear (hump-shaped) pattern and none of the three straight lines fits that pattern across the full range, which is consistent with the keyed correct answer D and the feedback statement. However, the missing A/B/C labels constitutes a content inconsistency between the diagram and the item text that references specific lines A, B, and C.
- nice_xd1453e7a095ed1a4_90377 -> The item text defines ∠A = 6x + 8° and ∠B = 4x + 48°, and the feedback asserts that because the two lines are parallel, ∠A and ∠B are alternate interior angles and therefore equal. Solving 6x + 8 = 4x + 48 gives x = 20, so ∠A = 6(20) + 8 = 128°. In the SVG, there are two horizontal lines (parallel) cut by a transversal from (200,120) to (240,280). The arcs labeled ∠A (top-right interior) and ∠B (bottom-left interior) are drawn as acute angles (small arcs clearly less than 90°), consistent with an acute alternate-interior pair for this transversal orientation. However, the computed measure 128° is obtuse, contradicting the acute appearance of both labeled angles in the diagram. There is no indication that the diagram is not to scale or that the obtuse angle is intended; thus the visual depiction conflicts with the numerical result and feedback.
- nice_xcc1979e181c52e92_36346 -> The SVG shows segment JK from J(-4, 1) to K(-1, 3) and segment NM from N(4, -1) to M(1, -3). These vectors are opposites: JK has direction (3, 2) and NM has direction (-3, -2) with equal length sqrt(13). A single rigid motion that maps JK onto NM is a 180° rotation about the origin (x, y) -> (-x, -y), which sends J to N and K to M. Therefore the statement in choice A (“a rotation would map JK onto NM”) is consistent with the diagram. However, the CORRECT feedback text asserts specifically that “a rotation about point N maps JK onto NM.” That is inconsistent with the diagram as presented: a rotation about N fixes N, but neither J nor K is at N initially, so a single rotation about N cannot send JK onto NM without a prior translation. The INCORRECT feedback actually describes a correct two-step sequence (“After translating to align a corresponding endpoint, a rotation about point N…”). Thus, while the choices align with the diagram, the CORRECT feedback’s specified center of rotation (about N) contradicts the geometric configuration in the SVG, where the appropriate single rotation center is the origin (or equivalently the common midpoint (0,0)).
- nice_x6654329a81441075_39763 -> The item text states that △A′B′C′ is obtained from △ABC by a dilation centered at A with scale factor 3/4, and the prompt asks the test-taker to select the diagram in which △A′B′C′ is shown with a solid outline. The geometry in choice B does match a dilation of scale 3/4 centered at A: A′ coincides with A (40,78), B′ = (40,78) + 3/4·(380−40, 44−78) = (295, 52.5), and C′ = (40,78) + 3/4·(244−40, 316−78) = (193, 256.5), which is exactly what the diagram shows. However, in all provided choice diagrams (A–D), the image triangle A′B′C′ is drawn with a dashed outline (green, stroke-dasharray), while the original △ABC is the one with a solid (black) outline. This directly contradicts the prompt’s requirement that △A′B′C′ be shown with a solid outline. Therefore, the visual presentation of the options is inconsistent with the textual instruction, even though the recorded correct option B matches the dilation numerically and geometrically.
- nice_xc39320dd4f6c8cb3_42250 -> The SVG shows triangle ABC with coordinates A(-4,1), B(-1,4), C(-2,-2) and triangle FED with F(-6,1.5), E(-1.5,6), D(-3,-3). These points satisfy (F,E, D) = 1.5 × (A, B, C) about the origin, i.e., FED is a dilation of ABC by a scale factor of 1.5. Therefore, the triangles have proportional side lengths (different lengths) but equal angle measures (similar triangles). The item’s scoring and prompt align with this: Maya’s conclusion that the triangles cannot be mapped using rigid transformations (and thus are not congruent) is correct, and the correct choice is C. However, the feedback explanation states that the triangles have different side lengths and angle measures, which contradicts the diagram; their angle measures are the same. Hence, the diagram is inconsistent with that textual feedback claim.
- nice_x9db06df2439903f9_92367 -> The item text and feedback describe a right triangle with legs 5 and 12 and hypotenuse x, using the Pythagorean Theorem to yield x = 13. The SVG diagram agrees on lengths and right angle: it labels the base AB as 5, the vertical BC as 12, the hypotenuse AC as x, and shows a 90° angle at B. However, the SVG also labels the angle at vertex A as 22.62°, which contradicts the given side lengths. For a 5–12–13 right triangle with the right angle at B, angle A should be arctan(12/5) ≈ 67.38°, while 22.62° is the complementary angle that should appear at vertex C. The diagram places 22.62° at A and labels the angle at C as θ, creating a mismatch between the angle annotation and the side-length labels (and thus with the mathematical information used in the feedback). Therefore, the diagram is not fully consistent with the item’s mathematical information.
- nice_xf5caad0b269d58a2_93673 -> The stem diagram shows a vertical red reflection line explicitly labeled with the italic ell character “ℓ” at x = 1, while the prompt text asks for the image after reflecting across line n (MathML <mi>n</mi>). No “n” appears in the diagram; only “ℓ” is shown. This is a notation mismatch between the textual prompt and the visual diagram. Aside from this, the mathematical content is internally consistent: point C is at (-3, 2) and reflecting across x = 1 yields (5, 2), which matches choice B and the declared correct response. However, the line label inconsistency makes the item visually/textually inconsistent.
- nice_xc242e81e1706e84a_67760 -> The prompt asks whether the graph shows y as a linear function of x, and the SVG indeed depicts a single straight line, so the choice of “Yes” is appropriate. However, the feedback adds a specific equation: “This slanted line can be written as y = 2x − 3.” That equation does not match the plotted line. From the SVG, the blue line is drawn from (x1,y1)=(73.4,568) to (x2,y2)=(380,−72) in pixel coordinates. With the graph’s origin at approximately (226.7,200) and equal scales of about 15.33 px per unit on both axes, this corresponds to roughly the math points (−10,−24) and (10,17.75). The resulting slope is (17.75−(−24))/(10−(−10))≈41.75/20≈2.09 and the y-intercept is about −3.13. Also, at x=0 (the y-axis), the line crosses near pixel y≈248.6, which is about 2.6 px below the −3 tick (≈246 px), again indicating b≈−3.1, not exactly −3. Therefore, while the graph is linear, it does not exactly represent y=2x−3 as stated in the feedback.
- nice_x273eba3da1745d5b_46932 -> The item text and feedback assert a right triangle with legs x and 4 and hypotenuse 5, leading (via the Pythagorean Theorem) to x=3. The SVG diagram labels match this for the sides: AB is labeled x, BC is labeled 4, and AC is labeled 5, with a right angle marked at B (90°). However, the diagram also explicitly shows an angle measure of 40° at vertex A. In a right triangle with hypotenuse 5 and one leg 4, the acute angles must be approximately 53.13° and 36.87°, not 40°. Thus the 40° label is inconsistent with the side lengths 4 and 5 presented in both the diagram and the textual/feedback explanation. This contradiction makes the visual information inconsistent with the problem’s stated numerical relationships.
- nice_x97803d5d79b595f8_20992 -> Text/MathML givens: m∠ABD = 89°, m∠CBD = 5x + 7°, m∠ABC = 6x + 5°. The feedback/solution computes x = 7, yielding m∠CBD = 5·7 + 7 = 42° and m∠ABC = 6·7 + 5 = 47°, and the item’s correct response is 42. In the SVG, point B is the vertex with rays BA, BC, BD. The diagram explicitly labels the two adjacent angles as 45° (∠ABC) and 44° (∠CBD) and the total ∠ABD as 89°. While 45° + 44° = 89° matches m∠ABD, the individual measures contradict the algebraic setup and expected answer: the diagram shows ∠CBD = 44° (not 42°) and ∠ABC = 45° (not 47°). Therefore, the diagram’s numeric labels are inconsistent with the text and the computed/expected values.
- nice_x9575a78de643d48e_68598 -> Parsing the item: The prompt asks which sequence of transformations carries WXYZ onto ABCD. The response-declaration marks C (Both sequences) as correct, and feedback states that each sequence maps WXYZ onto ABCD. From the SVG, using the drawn coordinate grid (origin at the intersection of the bold axes), the labeled vertices have exact integer coordinates: - W(-5, -1), X(-2, 1), Y(-3, 4), Z(-6, 2) - A(5, 1), B(2, -1), C(3, -4), D(6, -2) A single 180° rotation about the origin maps WXYZ to ABCD exactly: (-5,-1)->(5,1)=A; (-2,1)->(2,-1)=B; (-3,4)->(3,-4)=C; (-6,2)->(6,-2)=D. Now test the sequences provided: - Sequence A: Reflect across y = -x, then rotate 180° about (0,0), then translate by ⟨0,0⟩. The composition of reflecting across y = -x and then rotating 180° about the origin equals reflection across y = x. Applying to W(-5,-1): reflect y = -x gives (1,5); rotate 180° gives (-1,-5); translation ⟨0,0⟩ leaves (-1,-5), which does not match any of A, B, C, or D. Thus Sequence A does not map WXYZ to ABCD. - Sequence B: Reflect across x = 0 (y-axis), rotate 180° about (1,-1), then translate by ⟨-1,1⟩. Applying to W(-5,-1): after reflection → (5,-1); after rotation about (1,-1) → (2 - 5, -2 - (-1)) = (-3,-1); after translation ⟨-1,1⟩ → (-4,0). This also does not land on A, B, C, or D (and similarly fails for the other vertices). Thus Sequence B does not map WXYZ to ABCD. Therefore, according to the diagram, neither Sequence A nor Sequence B carries WXYZ onto ABCD; the correct choice should be D (Neither sequence). However, the item’s declared correct-response is C (Both sequences) and the feedback claims both sequences work. This contradicts the diagram.
- nice_x3c5606bed179c03c_89468 -> Parsed item: The stem states m∠LON is a straight angle; m∠MON = 4x + 41°, m∠LOM = 7x + 62°. Task: find m∠MON. The worked feedback solves (7x+62) + (4x+41) = 180 → 11x+103 = 180 → x = 7, hence m∠MON = 4(7)+41 = 69° and m∠LOM = 111°. Diagram analysis (SVG): Points L(40,160), O(210,160), N(380,160) form a straight horizontal line, consistent with ∠LON = 180°. Point M(320,70) is above-right of O, and arcs are drawn from near the left to OM (large arc) and from OM to the right horizontal (small arc). The small arc from approximately (245.6,130.9) to (256,160) with radius 40 represents the angle between ON (east) and OM; vector OM from O is (110, -90), which corresponds to an angle ≈ arctan(90/110) ≈ 40° above the +x axis. Thus the small arc is about 40°, and the large arc from 180° to ≈40° is about 140°. While the arcs do sum to 180° (consistent with a straight angle), they do not match the algebraic results (69° and 111°). Therefore, the visual angle measures implied by the SVG are not consistent with the textual/mathematical solution.
- nice_xe1d97e6285b663e0_87280 -> Text states the fitted regression line has slope 0.48 (hundreds of dollars per °C), with temperature on x and sales on y. The SVG’s axes confirm x = Temperature (°C), y = Sales (hundreds of dollars). However, the plotted blue “Fitted regression line” in the SVG has endpoints at (x1=66.4 px, y1=282.045 px) and (x2=400 px, y2=122.649 px). Using the axis scales from the SVG ticks: x-scale ≈ 11.12 px per °C (10→40 spans 333.6 px) and y-scale ≈ 9.672 px per hundred dollars (5→25 spans 241.8 px). The line’s Δx = 333.6 px = 30 °C; Δy = −159.397 px corresponds to +16.48 hundred dollars. Thus the line’s slope in data units is 16.48/30 ≈ 0.55 hundreds of dollars per °C, not 0.48. While labels/units are consistent, the numeric slope in the diagram contradicts the stated slope in the text/feedback.
- nice_x85b1af568c1e6a17_49690 -> The item states that A′ is the rotated image of A about center Q and asks for all angles describing this rotation. From the SVG coordinates: Q = (198.8235, 110.5882), A = (340.0000, 251.7647), A′ = (57.6471, 251.7647). Vector QA = (141.1765, 141.1765); vector QA′ = (−141.1764, 141.1765). This mapping corresponds to a 90° counterclockwise rotation about Q (and equivalently 270° clockwise). The other vertices confirm the same: B→B′ and C→C′ also match a 90° counterclockwise rotation. However, the response key marks A and E as correct (90° clockwise and 270° counterclockwise), and the CORRECT feedback repeats that ("270° counterclockwise" and "90° clockwise"). Those angles describe the opposite direction from what the diagram shows. The angles consistent with the diagram should be B and D (90° counterclockwise and 270° clockwise). All other textual labels (center Q, A/A′, etc.) are visually consistent; the inconsistency lies in the rotation direction used for scoring and feedback.
- nice_xfe0e823a7ded0a83_46072 -> Parsed item text states: Triangle ABC is rotated 240° about point P to form triangle A′B′C′. ∠A = 40°. Find ∠A′. The SVG shows an original triangle (solid), a rotated triangle (dashed green), and the rotation center P. Checking the geometry numerically from the SVG coordinates: P ≈ (212.983, 224.752). Original A ≈ (77.735, 360). Rotated A′ ≈ (163.479, 40). The vector P→A = (−135.248, 135.248). Rotating this vector by 120° counterclockwise gives approximately (−49.591, −184.839), which added to P yields (163.392, 39.913), matching A′. Rotating by 240° (equivalently −120°) would place A′ near (397.822, 274.343), which does not match the diagram. Similar checks for B→B′ agree with a 120° rotation. Therefore, the SVG depicts a 120° rotation about P, while the text says 240°. Although angle measure preservation means the numeric answer (40°) and feedback remain correct, the stated rotation magnitude is inconsistent with the drawn figure.
- nice_xf5c9afb23ccb0de4_47238 -> Text/MathML givens: m∠QPS = 120°, m∠RPS = 3x + 18°, m∠QPR = 7x + 12°. Solution and feedback use angle addition (QPR + RPS = QPS) to find x = 9, yielding m∠RPS = 45°. SVG analysis: Points are placed so that PQ is horizontal to the left from P, PR is vertical upward from P, and PS is a 45° NE ray. The colored arcs indicate: red arc from left to up (angle QPR) is a right angle (90°); green arc from up to NE (angle RPS) is about 45°; blue arc from left to NE (angle QPS) spans about 135° (90° + 45°). A text label in the SVG reads “120°” near the large angle. Contradictions: - Diagram geometry shows ∠QPR = 90°, but the item defines ∠QPR = 7x + 12°, which at the solved x = 9 equals 75°, not 90°. - Diagram geometry shows ∠QPS ≈ 135° (sum of the red 90° and green 45° arcs), but the item and the diagram’s text label state ∠QPS = 120°. - Although ∠RPS ≈ 45° in the drawing matches the computed answer, the other depicted angles conflict with the given numeric relationships. Therefore, the SVG diagram is not consistent with the textual/MathML information used in the problem and solution.
- nice_x96f329d4d5f67e9d_51172 -> The item states DE ∥ FG and KL ⟂ FG, and the SVG diagram reflects this: DE and FG are horizontal and parallel, KL is vertical (perpendicular to FG), and a transversal (diagonal) passes through both horizontal lines at x=240,y=100 and x≈156,y=220. The diagram shows a blue arc at the upper intersection between KL (vertical, upward ray) and the diagonal, labeled 28°. It also shows a green arc at the lower intersection between FG (horizontal, leftward ray) and the diagonal, labeled as angle x (the 'x' text is placed adjacent to this green arc). Geometrically, if the angle between the diagonal and the vertical is 28°, then the angle between the diagonal and the horizontal is its complement: 90° − 28° = 62°. Because DE ∥ FG, the corresponding angle between the diagonal and FG at the lower intersection (the one marked x) must be 62°. Therefore, the diagram and stated relationships imply ∠x = 62°, not 28°. However, the response key and feedback assert the correct measure of ∠x is 28°, and the feedback reasoning references vertical angles and a right angle, which would actually lead to x = 62° via triangle angle sum. This is a contradiction between the diagram/geometry and the keyed answer/feedback.
- nice_x150506e4_95506 -> The SVG shows a position–time graph with x-axis labeled time (hours) and y-axis labeled distance (km). The plotted data points imply: Alberto goes from (t=0 h, d=0 km) to (1 h, 20 km), stops from 1–2 h (flat at 20 km), then proceeds to reach 50 km at 5 h. Bianca goes from 0 km to 15 km (first hour), then to 32 km (second hour), and reaches 50 km at 3 h, with her slope increasing each hour. These visuals support the item prompts and correct responses: early in the race Alberto is faster; Alberto’s first-hour speed is 20 km/h; Bianca’s speed is increasing; Bianca reaches the finish line first. However, the CORRECT feedback text states “she reaches x = 50 km first,” which contradicts the diagram’s axis labeling: x is time, not distance. The finish line corresponds to y = 50 km. This axis mislabel in the feedback makes the item text and diagram inconsistent, even though the answers themselves align with the graph.
- nice_x7cf297ed141d8624_42375 -> The item asks: “Which labeled line is the best fit for the data shown?” with choices A, B, C, and D. The decoded SVG shows a scatter plot with three candidate regression lines: a solid blue line (#1E90FF), a dashed red line (#FF6B6B), and a solid green line (#2ECC71). However, the SVG contains no A/B/C labels for these lines. The legend area on the right draws three colored line samples, but the adjacent <text> elements are empty, so the lines are not labeled in the diagram. This contradicts the prompt’s requirement to select a labeled line and makes it impossible to map choices A, B, C to the drawn lines. Additionally, the response key specifies C as correct and feedback states “line C matches the data best.” By visual inspection of the plotted points, the blue line appears to pass most centrally through the point cloud, the red dashed line is too steep, and the green line is too shallow. If the intended mapping is the typical legend order A=blue, B=red, C=green, then “C” would correspond to the green line, which does not appear to be the best fit. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the textual instructions and potentially with the keyed answer/feedback.
- nice_x74647907189b3500_37131 -> The item text and feedback state a right triangle with legs 3 and 7 and hypotenuse x, leading to x = √58 via the Pythagorean Theorem. The SVG diagram labels the horizontal leg AB as 3, the vertical leg BC as 7, and the slanted side AC as x, with a right angle at B—this aligns with the textual/math content and the correct choice B. However, the same SVG also labels the acute angles as 40° at A and 50° at C. These angle measures are incompatible with the labeled leg lengths: with AB = 3 and BC = 7, angle A should be arctan(7/3) ≈ 66.8° and angle C ≈ 23.2°, not 40° and 50°. Thus, the diagram contains contradictory information relative to the side lengths used in the text/solution, creating an inconsistency.
- nice_xbb0025f583b277ba_78526 -> Text/MathML states OA ⟂ OC and defines m∠BOC = 7x − 14°, m∠AOB = 3x + 24°. The feedback solves x = 8, giving m∠AOB = 48° and m∠BOC = 42°, so AOB > BOC. The SVG shows O at (200,200), A at (360,200) (ray OA to the right), C at (200,60) (ray OC upward), and B at (300,120). From these coordinates, ∠AOB ≈ arctan(80/100) ≈ 38.7°, and ∠BOC ≈ 90° − 38.7° ≈ 51.3°. The drawn arcs confirm this: the blue arc from A to OB is about 39°, and the green arc from OB to C is about 51°. Thus, the diagram depicts AOB < BOC, contradicting the item’s computed measures where AOB = 48° and BOC = 42°. Perpendicularity (OA ⟂ OC) is consistent, but the relative and approximate magnitudes of the angles in the diagram do not match the numeric relationships in the text/feedback.
- nice_x64eedd0feaf0a4e9_67541 -> The SVG shows ABCD (solid, navy stroke) rotated about point Q = (173.3333, 226.6667) to A′B′C′D′ (dashed, green stroke). Checking vectors from Q confirms a 90° clockwise rotation (equivalently 270° counterclockwise): for example, A at (253.3333, 360) gives QA = (80, 133.3333). A′ at (306.6667, 146.6667) gives QA′ = (133.3333, −80), which is QA rotated by −90° (clockwise). Similarly, B at (360, 253.3333) maps to B′ at (200, 40) under the same −90° rotation. Thus the correct descriptions are 90° clockwise (choice A) or 270° counterclockwise (choice E). However, the item’s correct-response key lists B (90° counterclockwise) and D (270° clockwise), and the feedback states the same, which contradicts the diagram. Therefore, the diagram and the keyed answers/feedback are inconsistent.
- nice_x3dfbe830c807017f_26963 -> The stem diagram shows quadrilateral ABCD and its image A'B'C'D' reflected across the y-axis (x = 0). From the grid coordinates: B is at (−2, 6) and B' at (2, 6); C is at (−3, 3) and C' at (3, 3); A is at (−2, 1) and A' at (2, 1); D is at (−3, −2) and D' at (3, −2). The midpoint of each corresponding pair lies on x = 0, not x = 2. The choice graphics confirm this: option B draws the red mirror line at x = 0 (x = 223.56 px, the y‑axis), option A at x = −1, and option C at x = 2. The declared correct answer (B) matches the diagram (x = 0). However, the CORRECT feedback text claims the mirror line is x = 2 and cites midpoints (2,6) between B(−2,6) and B'(6,6) and (2,3) between C(−3,3) and C'(7,3). Those coordinates do not match the plotted image points (B' is (2,6), C' is (3,3)), and the true midpoints are (0,6) and (0,3). Therefore, the textual/MathML feedback is inconsistent with the diagrams and answer choice graphics.
- nice_xa7db199ea7832174_46445 -> The item text asks for the length of x in an isosceles triangle. The feedback/explanation uses the altitude to the base from the apex, bisecting the base: it explicitly applies 4^2 + x^2 = (√52)^2, implying base AB = 8 (so half-base = 4) and the equal legs are √52, yielding x = 6. In the SVG, however: (1) The dashed segment labeled x runs from vertex A to the right side BC and is marked perpendicular to BC, indicating an altitude from A to side BC, not an altitude from the apex C to the base AB. (2) The base AB is labeled √52 at its center, while the left slanted side AC is also labeled √52; meanwhile the number 8 appears along the right slanted side BC. This directly contradicts the feedback’s geometry (legs √52, base 8). Thus, both the placement of x and the side-length labels in the diagram are inconsistent with the textual explanation and the calculation leading to x = 6.
- nice_x30366029fe19592e_51445 -> Parsed item: The stem states m∠QPS is a straight angle. Given m∠QPR = 5x + 15° and m∠RPS = 7x + 21°. Find m∠QPR. The feedback solves (5x+15) + (7x+21) = 180 ⇒ x = 12, yielding m∠QPR = 75° and m∠RPS = 105°. SVG analysis: Points Q(60,200), P(210,200), S(360,200) are collinear (straight line), and R(290,120) is above-right of P. The arcs drawn indicate ∠QPR (blue) from left horizontal PQ to PR, and ∠RPS (green) from PR to right horizontal PS. With PR along vector (80, -80), the angle from PS (rightward) to PR is 45°, so m∠RPS ≈ 45°, and from PQ (leftward) to PR is ≈ 135°, so m∠QPR ≈ 135°. Thus the diagram depicts ∠QPR > ∠RPS and an obtuse ∠QPR. In contrast, the algebraic relations and solution require ∠QPR = 75° (acute) and ∠RPS = 105° (obtuse), i.e., ∠RPS > ∠QPR. While the diagram correctly shows Q, P, S collinear (a straight angle), it contradicts the stated and solved measures by showing the right-hand angle smaller than the left and by depicting ∠QPR as obtuse rather than 75°. No “not to scale” disclaimer appears to reconcile this. Therefore the diagram is inconsistent with the textual/mathematical information.
- nice_xbbbde7ff25ddf0ae_40212 -> The numeric and geometric information about the rectangles is consistent: the original rectangle EFGH in the SVG has sides labeled 3 (vertical) and 4 (horizontal), and the rotated rectangle E′F′G′H′ is shown dashed. The feedback calculates the area as 3 × 4 = 12, which matches the side labels in the diagram. However, there is a labeling inconsistency regarding the center of rotation. The item text states the rectangle is rotated about point R, but the SVG shows a single rotation center labeled P (blue point) and no point R. This mismatch between the textual description and the diagram’s label constitutes an inconsistency, even though it does not change the numerical answer for area.
- nice_x03f872387a8cca62_49539 -> The item prompt asks whether the shown triangle is right-angled using the areas of the attached squares. The feedback and correct response assert it is not right-angled because a^2=9, b^2=10, c^2=20 and 9+10=19≠20. The SVG diagram’s numeric labels on the three squares are consistent with those values: the square on side a shows 9, on side b shows 10, and on side c shows 20. However, the SVG explicitly includes a right-angle marker (a small square) at the vertex between sides a and b of the triangle (at coordinates around (257.9, 261.0)), visually indicating the triangle is right-angled. This visual cue directly contradicts the text and feedback that the triangle is not right-angled. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the item’s textual/mathematical information and the keyed answer.
- nice_xce9d3c2f6242a138_10529 -> The item text states Asha hikes 2 km north (vertical leg) and an unknown distance west x (horizontal leg), with the straight-line distance 5 km. The feedback computes x = sqrt(5^2 − 2^2) ≈ 4.6 accordingly. However, the SVG labels the horizontal base AB as “2” and the vertical leg BC as “x”, with the hypotenuse AC labeled “5”. The angle at C is shown as 23.6°, which matches sin(C) = 2/5, further confirming that the base (horizontal) is 2 and the vertical is x in the diagram. This reverses the roles of the north and west distances compared to the problem statement. While the numerical result 4.6 remains correct for the unknown leg, the diagram contradicts the textual description about which leg is 2 (north) and which is x (west).
- nice_xffe4fe69c7ada6c6_85181 -> The item text states that the area of the largest square is 65, and the SVG shows the square on the hypotenuse (rotated diamond) labeled 65, which aligns with the Pythagorean context a^2 + b^2 = c^2. However, the SVG also depicts the two squares on the legs as congruent (both are 120×120 rectangles) and the right triangle’s legs as equal in length (each leg segment is 120 units), implying a = b and therefore the two smaller squares must have equal areas. The answer options (and the marked correct answer A: 23 and 42) present unequal areas for the two smaller squares, contradicting the visual information that the smaller squares are equal in area. There is no disclaimer that the figure is not to scale. Thus, the diagram’s equal-leg/equal-square depiction is inconsistent with the answer logic that accepts unequal areas summing to 65.
- nice_x16ee633daf39c1bc_88591 -> The item text asks for x in an isosceles triangle and the feedback solution states that drawing the altitude from the apex to the base creates two right triangles with legs 6 and 8 and hypotenuse x, yielding x=10. This implies: (a) the isosceles triangle’s equal sides are the slanted legs and are labeled x (hypotenuse of the right triangle), (b) the base is 12 so that each half-base is 6, and (c) the altitude (from the apex to the base) is 8. However, the SVG contradicts these points in multiple ways: - The base AB is explicitly labeled with “x” (text at y≈335.7 along the base), while the feedback uses x as the hypotenuse (one of the equal sides). This creates two different meanings of x within the same figure (the base and a slanted side), and thus ambiguity. - A second “x” label appears along the left slanted side AC, so two distinct segments (AB and AC) are both marked x. The feedback’s interpretation requires x to denote the equal slanted side(s), not the base. Having the base also labeled x conflicts with the stated calculation. - The number “12” appears placed along the right slanted side (rotated about a point on that side), not on the base. In the feedback logic, 12 should be the full base length so that each half-base is 6. Its placement on a slanted side is inconsistent with the explanation. - The dashed segment shown is drawn from vertex A to side BC, with a right-angle marker at the intersection with BC. The feedback describes dropping the altitude from the apex to the base; the drawn dashed line is not that altitude and does not split the base into two equal parts of 6 as the explanation implies. - Although the dashed segment is labeled “8,” matching the feedback’s altitude length, its placement (A to BC) does not match the described construction (apex to base), so the geometry does not support the feedback’s calculation path. Due to these labeling and construction mismatches, the diagram is not consistent with the text and feedback calculations that lead to x=10.
- nice_x990af93fa6f24178_75890 -> The item asks for the measure of x using corresponding angles in parallel lines and the scoring/feedback asserts x = 118°. However, the SVG diagram provides no numeric angle label of 118° anywhere—only the variable label “x” and two blue arc marks. Moreover, the diagram’s geometry shows a single straight transversal with slope 1 crossing two horizontal parallel lines, which creates acute angles of approximately 45° (and obtuse angles of 135°). The blue arcs drawn at both intersections mark the small acute angle from the rightward horizontal ray to the diagonal (consistent with ~45°), not 118°. Therefore, the diagram does not support the stated numeric answer or feedback. The figure is missing any 118° label and visually suggests 45°/135°, contradicting the XML’s correct response and feedback explanation.
- nice_x5c35f5a3105525d6_17748 -> Parsed item text and MathML: Given m∠QPS = 80°, m∠RPS = 4x + 8°, m∠QPR = 6x + 12°. The solution/feedback uses angle addition (∠QPR + ∠RPS = ∠QPS) to find x = 6 and m∠QPR = 48°. The SVG shows P at (200,200) with rays to Q (90,180), R (200,80), and S (320,190). Three arcs are drawn: blue between PQ and PR (∠QPR), green between PR and PS (∠RPS), and orange between PQ and PS (∠QPS). From the coordinates, direction angles from P are approximately: PQ ≈ 190.3°, PR = 270°, PS ≈ 355.2°. Therefore the implied measures are ∠QPR ≈ 270−190.3 ≈ 79.7°, ∠RPS ≈ 355.2−270 ≈ 85.2°, and ∠QPS ≈ 355.2−190.3 ≈ 164.9°. Thus the diagram depicts ∠QPS as an obtuse angle near 165°, not 80° as stated, and the blue+green arcs sum to about 165°, not 80°. Additionally, the diagram suggests ∠RPS > ∠QPR, whereas the solved textual values give ∠QPR = 48° and ∠RPS = 32°. Hence the visual information is not consistent with the textual/mathematical information.
- nice_x15dec89422453948_87058 -> The item asks for the area of a parallelogram. The SVG shows a parallelogram with both bases labeled 4 and a dashed vertical altitude labeled x; there is a right-angle marker at the base of the dashed line. No other numeric labels appear in the diagram. The feedback/explanation, however, relies on a right triangle with legs 3 and x and hypotenuse 5 to conclude x = 4 (using 3^2 + x^2 = 5^2), then computes area = 4 × 4 = 16. The diagram does not display any 3 or 5 labels, nor a marked segment indicating length 3 or 5; it only shows 4, 4, and x. While the side slope in the SVG is consistent with a 3-4-5 ratio, this is not conveyed numerically to the test-taker. Therefore, the visual information is incomplete relative to the textual/mathematical explanation, and the solution references quantities (3 and 5) not present in the diagram, creating a mismatch.
- nice_x6212194cf8844209_76530 -> Parsed item: The prompt asks for x in an isosceles triangle. The feedback computes x by dropping an altitude to the (non-equal) base, using b = 2 and c = √13 to get a = 3, hence base x = 2a = 6. Decoded SVG: - The triangle vertices are labeled A (left bottom), B (right bottom), C (top). - Two sides are labeled √13: AB (the bottom horizontal segment) and AC (left slanted side), indicating AB = AC = √13 (isosceles with vertex A). - A dashed segment from A to side BC is marked 2, with a right-angle mark at the foot, indicating the altitude from A to the base BC is length 2. - The unknown x is labeled along the right slanted side BC, consistent with x being the isosceles base (the unequal side). These elements align with the feedback’s calculation that uses b = 2, c = √13 and yields x = 6. However, the SVG also shows internal angle measures: ∠A = 70°, ∠B = 55°, ∠C = 55°. These angles are inconsistent with the side/altitude data and the computed answer. If AB = AC = √13 and the altitude from A to BC is 2, then the base BC computes to 6, which implies ∠A ≈ 112.6° and ∠B = ∠C ≈ 33.7°, not 70°/55°/55°. Conversely, if the angles are 70°, 55°, 55° and AB = AC = √13, the base would be ≈ 4.14 by the Law of Sines, not 6. Therefore the diagram’s angle annotations contradict the numeric lengths used in the text/feedback and the intended correct answer.

    "explanation": "The item text and solution reasoning describe an isosceles triangle where the altitude from the apex bisects the base, yielding two right triangles with legs a and 8 and hypotenuse 10, leading to a=6 and base x=2a=12. However, the SVG labeling contradicts this: (1) The base AB is explicitly labeled “10” (not x), while x is labeled along side AC; the feedback treats x as the base length. (2) A length “10” is also labeled along side BC, suggesting BC=10; if AC and BC were the equal legs of an isosceles triangle, the base should be x, not 10. (3) The length “8” is drawn as a perpendicular from vertex B to side AC (with a right-angle marker at the foot), not as an altitude from the apex (vertex C) to the base as used in the feedback’s derivation. Thus the diagram’s geometry and labels (base=10, BC=10, x on AC, 8 from B to AC) do not match the textual explanation and the calculation that x (the base) equals 12.

The SVG, however, fixes the rays so that AB is horizontal left from B, BC is vertical up from B, and BD is down-right from B.

For this isosceles triangle (AB = AC = 5, BC = 6), the altitude from A to BC would indeed be x = sqrt(5^2 − (6/2)^2) = sqrt(25 − 9) = 4, matching the keyed answer and the feedback method.\nHowever, the same SVG also displays angle measures: ∠A = 40°, ∠B = 70°, and ∠C = 70°. These angles are inconsistent with the side lengths 5, 5, and 6. For a 5–5–6 isosceles triangle, ∠A (opposite side BC = 6) would be approximately 73.74°, and the base angles at B and C would be approximately 53.13°, not 70°. Thus, the diagram contains contradictory information (angles vs. side lengths). While the side-lengths and altitude depiction are consistent with the feedback and correct answer x = 4, the angle labels contradict that same configuration. Because the SVG’s visual data are internally inconsistent, the item’s diagram is not fully consistent with the mathematical information used to justify the correct answer.",

The choices include that a reflection would map ΔABC onto ΔFED (choice B, marked correct). The SVG shows two triangles on a coordinate grid: A(2,2), B(4,−2), C(1,−2) and F(−2,2), E(−4,−2), D(−1,−2).

Thus the item’s correct key and the main prompt/choice text are consistent with the diagram. However, the “INCORRECT” feedback block states: “After rotating ΔABC about point C, a reflection across a vertical line through the midpoint of segment DE completes the mapping onto ΔFED.” In the diagram, point C is at (1,−2). Any rotation about C leaves C at (1,−2). The midpoint of DE is ( (−4+−1)/2, (−2+−2)/2 ) = (−2.5, −2); the vertical reflection line is x=−2.5. Reflecting C across x=−2.5 sends x=1 to x′=2(−2.5)−1=−6, giving (−6,−2), which is not any of F(−2,2), E(−4,−2), or D(−1,−2). Therefore the described two‑step transformation cannot map ΔABC onto ΔFED as drawn. The only vertical line that maps C(1,−2) to D(−1,−2) is x=0 (the y‑axis), and no preliminary rotation about C preserves C’s location to then achieve that via x=−2.5.

However, the SVG also labels the angle at vertex A as 22.62°, which contradicts the given side lengths. For a 5–12–13 right triangle with the right angle at B, angle A should be arctan(12/5) ≈ 67.38°, while 22.62° is the complementary angle that should appear at vertex C. The diagram places 22.62° at A and labels the angle at C as θ, creating a mismatch between the angle annotation and the side-length labels (and thus with the mathematical information used in the feedback).

However, the SVG explicitly includes a right-angle marker (a small square) at the vertex between sides a and b of the triangle (at coordinates around (257.9, 261.0)), visually indicating the triangle is right-angled. This visual cue directly contradicts the text and feedback that the triangle is not right-angled. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the item’s textual/mathematical information and the keyed answer.",

    "explanation": "The item text states Asha hikes 2 km north (vertical leg) and an unknown distance west x (horizontal leg), with the straight-line distance 5 km. The feedback computes x = sqrt(5^2 − 2^2) ≈ 4.6 accordingly. However, the SVG labels the horizontal base AB as “2” and the vertical leg BC as “x”, with the hypotenuse AC labeled “5”. The angle at C is shown as 23.6°, which matches sin(C) = 2/5, further confirming that the base (horizontal) is 2 and the vertical is x in the diagram. This reverses the roles of the north and west distances compared to the problem statement. While the numerical result 4.6 remains correct for the unknown leg, the diagram contradicts the textual description about which leg is 2 (north) and which is x (west).",

    "explanation": "The item text states that the area of the largest square is 65, and the SVG shows the square on the hypotenuse (rotated diamond) labeled 65, which aligns with the Pythagorean context a^2 + b^2 = c^2. However, the SVG also depicts the two squares on the legs as congruent (both are 120×120 rectangles) and the right triangle’s legs as equal in length (each leg segment is 120 units), implying a = b and therefore the two smaller squares must have equal areas. The answer options (and the marked correct answer A: 23 and 42) present unequal areas for the two smaller squares, contradicting the visual information that the smaller squares are equal in area. There is no disclaimer that the figure is not to scale. Thus, the diagram’s equal-leg/equal-square depiction is inconsistent with the answer logic that accepts unequal areas summing to 65.",

    "explanation": "The item text asks for x in an isosceles triangle and the feedback solution states that drawing the altitude from the apex to the base creates two right triangles with legs 6 and 8 and hypotenuse x, yielding x=10. This implies: (a) the isosceles triangle’s equal sides are the slanted legs and are labeled x (hypotenuse of the right triangle), (b) the base is 12 so that each half-base is 6, and (c) the altitude (from the apex to the base) is 8.\nHowever, the SVG contradicts these points in multiple ways:\n- The base AB is explicitly labeled with “x” (text at y≈335.7 along the base), while the feedback uses x as the hypotenuse (one of the equal sides). This creates two different meanings of x within the same figure (the base and a slanted side), and thus ambiguity.\n- A second “x” label appears along the left slanted side AC, so two distinct segments (AB and AC) are both marked x. The feedback’s interpretation requires x to denote the equal slanted side(s), not the base. Having the base also labeled x conflicts with the stated calculation.\n- The number “12” appears placed along the right slanted side (rotated about a point on that side), not on the base. In the feedback logic, 12 should be the full base length so that each half-base is 6. Its placement on a slanted side is inconsistent with the explanation.\n- The dashed segment shown is drawn from vertex A to side BC, with a right-angle marker at the intersection with BC. The feedback describes dropping the altitude from the apex to the base; the drawn dashed line is not that altitude and does not split the base into two equal parts of 6 as the explanation implies.\n- Although the dashed segment is labeled “8,” matching the feedback’s altitude length, its placement (A to BC) does not match the described construction (apex to base), so the geometry does not support the feedback’s calculation path.\nDue to these labeling and construction mismatches, the diagram is not consistent with the text and feedback calculations that lead to x=10.",

    "explanation": "The item asks for the measure of x using corresponding angles in parallel lines and the scoring/feedback asserts x = 118°. However, the SVG diagram provides no numeric angle label of 118° anywhere—only the variable label “x” and two blue arc marks. Moreover, the diagram’s geometry shows a single straight transversal with slope 1 crossing two horizontal parallel lines, which creates acute angles of approximately 45° (and obtuse angles of 135°). The blue arcs drawn at both intersections mark the small acute angle from the rightward horizontal ray to the diagonal (consistent with ~45°), not 118°. Therefore, the diagram does not support the stated numeric answer or feedback. The figure is missing any 118° label and visually suggests 45°/135°, contradicting the XML’s correct response and feedback explanation.",

    "explanation": "Parsed item text and MathML: Given m∠QPS = 80°, m∠RPS = 4x + 8°, m∠QPR = 6x + 12°. The solution/feedback uses angle addition (∠QPR + ∠RPS = ∠QPS) to find x = 6 and m∠QPR = 48°. The SVG shows P at (200,200) with rays to Q (90,180), R (200,80), and S (320,190). Three arcs are drawn: blue between PQ and PR (∠QPR), green between PR and PS (∠RPS), and orange between PQ and PS (∠QPS). From the coordinates, direction angles from P are approximately: PQ ≈ 190.3°, PR = 270°, PS ≈ 355.2°. Therefore the implied measures are ∠QPR ≈ 270−190.3 ≈ 79.7°, ∠RPS ≈ 355.2−270 ≈ 85.2°, and ∠QPS ≈ 355.2−190.3 ≈ 164.9°. Thus the diagram depicts ∠QPS as an obtuse angle near 165°, not 80° as stated, and the blue+green arcs sum to about 165°, not 80°. Additionally, the diagram suggests ∠RPS > ∠QPR, whereas the solved textual values give ∠QPR = 48° and ∠RPS = 32°. Hence the visual information is not consistent with the textual/mathematical information.",

The SVG shows a parallelogram with both bases labeled 4 and a dashed vertical altitude labeled x; there is a right-angle marker at the base of the dashed line. No other numeric labels appear in the diagram. The feedback/explanation, however, relies on a right triangle with legs 3 and x and hypotenuse 5 to conclude x = 4 (using 3^2 + x^2 = 5^2), then computes area = 4 × 4 = 16. The diagram does not display any 3 or 5 labels, nor a marked segment indicating length 3 or 5; it only shows 4, 4, and x. While the side slope in the SVG is consistent with a 3-4-5 ratio, this is not conveyed numerically to the test-taker. Therefore, the visual information is incomplete relative to the textual/mathematical explanation, and the solution references quantities (3 and 5) not present in the diagram, creating a mismatch.",

    "explanation": "Parsed item: The prompt asks for x in an isosceles triangle. The feedback computes x by dropping an altitude to the (non-equal) base, using b = 2 and c = √13 to get a = 3, hence base x = 2a = 6. Decoded SVG: - The triangle vertices are labeled A (left bottom), B (right bottom), C (top). - Two sides are labeled √13: AB (the bottom horizontal segment) and AC (left slanted side), indicating AB = AC = √13 (isosceles with vertex A). - A dashed segment from A to side BC is marked 2, with a right-angle mark at the foot, indicating the altitude from A to the base BC is length 2. - The unknown x is labeled along the right slanted side BC, consistent with x being the isosceles base (the unequal side). These elements align with the feedback’s calculation that uses b = 2, c = √13 and yields x = 6. However, the SVG also shows internal angle measures: ∠A = 70°, ∠B = 55°, ∠C = 55°. These angles are inconsistent with the side/altitude data and the computed answer. If AB = AC = √13 and the altitude from A to BC is 2, then the base BC computes to 6, which implies ∠A ≈ 112.6° and ∠B = ∠C ≈ 33.7°, not 70°/55°/55°. Conversely, if the angles are 70°, 55°, 55° and AB = AC = √13, the base would be ≈ 4.14 by the Law of Sines, not 6. Therefore the diagram’s angle annotations contradict the numeric lengths used in the text/feedback and the intended correct answer.",
