Failing items for nice_x0267d782 (count=44):
- nice_xecfa7f81ad9a97f8_35741 -> The item stem states: "Jamal recorded the list prices of 5 used cars." and that each price was a different amount between $5,000 and $7,000, except for one car priced at $24,000. Interpreted literally, this yields 5 total prices: 4 between $5,000 and $7,000 and 1 at $24,000. However, the SVG shows six data points: five points in the $5,000–$7,000 range (at approximately $5,200, $5,600, $6,000, $6,400, $6,800) and one at $24,000. Thus, the diagram depicts 6 prices, contradicting the text’s statement of 5 used cars. Axis labeling and the $24,000 point are otherwise consistent with the text, and the qualitative effect on mean/median matches the keyed answer, but the count of data points is inconsistent.
- nice_xf49885bd8acb0a4e_45010 -> The item asks: “Which side is perpendicular to the marked altitude (the corresponding base)?” The SVG shows triangle ABC with a red dashed line drawn from vertex B to side AC, with a right-angle marker at the foot on AC. Therefore, the altitude is perpendicular to side AC, making AC the corresponding base. The choices are labeled A, B, C, and the diagram labels vertices A, B, C (no sides are labeled). If choices refer to sides by the conventional opposite-vertex naming, the base AC corresponds to side b (i.e., choice B), not A. However, the QTI declares the correct response as A. Thus, the declared correct answer contradicts the diagram: the perpendicular side is AC (associated with B), not A.
- nice_x0823b6c5a77762ce_62316 -> Parsed item: A choice question asks which is larger, m or n. Feedback asserts n = −1 because the point (m, n) shares the same vertical coordinate as (2, −1), and that m > 4 because the point (m, 0) lies to the right of (4, 0). SVG analysis: The axes have 0 at y=230, −2 at y=261.6667, etc. The point labeled “(4, 0)” is drawn at y=230 (consistent). However, the point labeled “(2, −1)” is drawn at cy=261.6667, which corresponds to y = −2, not −1. The lower two vertices of the parallelogram and the point labeled “(−4, n)” are also at y=261.6667, so the diagram implies n = −2. Therefore the feedback’s statement that n = −1 contradicts the actual plotted y-position. While the conclusion m > n still holds visually (the point (m, 0) is to the right of (4, 0)), the numeric reasoning in the feedback (n = −1) does not match the diagram, and it also refers to a point (m, n) that is not explicitly plotted (the diagram shows separate points (m, 0) and (−4, n)). Hence, the diagram and the textual/MathML reasoning are inconsistent.
- nice_x17814ace06d69e26_10462 -> The SVG shows a rectangular prism with base edge labels 2 and 6 (implying base area = 12 square units) and a height label "h = 8 units." The item’s feedback and the correct response instead use a height of 2 1/4 units (2.25) and compute Volume = 12 × 2.25 = 27 units^3, which matches the declared correct answer (27). This contradicts the diagram’s height of 8 units, which would give Volume = 12 × 8 = 96 units^3. While the base area (2 and 6) is consistent, the height value is inconsistent between the diagram (8) and the text/answer (2 1/4), leading to an overall inconsistency.
- nice_x6089758dca05221e_60042 -> Parsed item: Students must pick an equation matching the tape diagram, then solve for w. The SVG shows a top bar labeled Total with a dimension line marked 25. The lower bar labeled Parts is split into a left segment labeled 10 and a right hatched segment labeled w. The widths are proportional (168:252 = 2:3), consistent with 10 and 15 summing to 25. The feedback text and MathML state the matching equation is 25 = 10 + w and solve to w = 15, which is consistent with the diagram. However, the choice list includes both B: 25 = 10 + w and C: 25 = w + 10. Both are mathematically equivalent and both match the diagram (total equals sum of parts), yet the correct-response marks only B as correct. This creates an inconsistency between the diagram (which supports either order of addition) and the assessment logic/answer key. All numeric labels in the SVG (25, 10, w) and the feedback solution (w=15) align; the only issue is that an equally valid matching equation (choice C) is not accepted.
- nice_x12d0d102580e3795_81919 -> The item’s text and feedback reference a right triangular prism with triangular legs 6 and 8 and prism length 7, leading to surface-area components: two triangles of area 24 each (1/2·6·8), and three rectangles with areas 6·7=42, 8·7=56, and 10·7=70 (where 10 is the hypotenuse from a 6-8-10 triangle). The decoded SVG, however, only labels two dimensions: “8” on the triangular face and “7” along the prism length. There is no “6” label on the triangle and no “10” label for the hypotenuse. Because the correct answer and feedback calculations explicitly rely on a 6-unit leg (and implicitly on the 10-unit hypotenuse), the diagram does not provide all the dimensions used in the mathematical expressions. This is a mismatch between the visual information and the numerical values used in the choices/feedback.
- nice_x739ada47a499180b_24385 -> The item asks for the total surface area (TSA) of the triangular prism shown, with a single numeric response expected. The SVG labels indicate: base of the front triangle = 12 (number centered below the base), the dashed interior altitude of the front triangle = 10 (label near the dashed line), and the prism length between the two triangular faces = 14 (label near the back face). Using these dimensions: area of one triangle = 1/2 * 12 * 10 = 60; two triangles total 120. For the lateral area, the triangle appears isosceles (apex above the midpoint), so each equal side = sqrt((12/2)^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(136) ≈ 11.662; triangle perimeter ≈ 12 + 2*11.662 = 35.324. Lateral area = perimeter * length ≈ 35.324 * 14 ≈ 494.535. TSA ≈ 120 + 494.535 ≈ 614.535, which does not match the declared correct answer 516. Even interpreting the triangle as right-angled with legs 10 and 12 gives TSA ≈ 646.68, also not 516. Therefore, the diagram’s dimensions (12, 10, 14) are inconsistent with the item’s correct-response value of 516 and the feedback expectation.
- nice_x24a5d0824f1a3298_50258 -> The SVG shows a vertical number line labeled from 12 (bottom) to 18 (top) with evenly spaced ticks at 12, 13, 14, 15 (unlabeled), 16, 17, 18. A blue point is plotted exactly at the unlabeled tick corresponding to 15, which matches the correct response and the correct feedback statement. However, the incorrect feedback claims each tick mark represents 5 units and advises counting from 0, which contradicts the SVG: ticks increase by 1 unit between labeled values, and 0 is not shown anywhere on the displayed number line. Additionally, the stem references a "question mark" while the graphic shows a plotted point, a minor presentational mismatch. Due to these contradictions, the item is inconsistent.
- nice_xec222d3628f91694_89452 -> Prompt: Choose the number line where the dot is at 6. Correct answer declared: B. The three SVGs show the same number line with major labels at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 (x=20,110,200,290,380). Dot locations: A at x=290 (label 9), B at x=200 (label 6), C at x=110 (label 3). Thus, the correct response B matches the dot at 6, consistent with the prompt and correct-response declaration. However, the incorrect feedback states: "each tick mark is 3 units apart." In all SVGs there are minor tick marks at intermediate positions (e.g., x=50,80 between 0 and 3; similarly between other major labels), which correspond to 1-unit increments, while the major (longer, labeled) ticks are 3 units apart. Therefore, the blanket statement that each tick mark is 3 units apart is inconsistent with the diagrams, which clearly display ticks at 1-unit spacing between the labeled 3-unit intervals. Other feedback text is consistent (B’s dot is at 6). Because this mismatch could affect interpretation of the interaction, the item is flagged inconsistent.
- nice_x95e0733a6b5c27cc_44337 -> The SVG shows a 10×10 grid (120×120 outer border with 10 rows and 10 columns of 12×12 cells). The top four rows (y = 0, 12, 24, 36) are filled/shaded across all 10 columns, for a total of 40 shaded squares out of 100, which corresponds to 40%. This matches the correct response value (40) and the percent stated in the feedback. However, the feedback text claims, “There are 4 shaded columns out of 10,” which contradicts the diagram: the figure has 4 shaded rows, not columns. While the numeric result remains 40%, the orientation described in the feedback is inconsistent with the visual diagram.
- nice_x444d0678bef5498e_22888 -> The prompt and feedback specify triangle vertices at (-6, 2), (2, -3), and (5, 7). The declared correct choice is A. Inspecting the SVGs shows the base coordinate grid is consistent (x- and y-axes labeled from -10 to 10). However, in choice A (SVG 2), the plotted polygon uses points at pixel coordinates (134.72,168), (257.36,248), and (303.35,88). These map to coordinates (-6, 2), (2, -3), and (4, 7), respectively: x=303.35 is explicitly labeled as 4 on the x-axis, and y=88 corresponds to 7 from the y-axis labels. Thus A plots (4,7), not (5,7). Choices B and C also do not include a point at x=5 (they use the same 303.35 x-position for the top vertex). Therefore, none of the provided diagrams matches the stated vertices, yet the correct response is set to A. This is a contradiction between the text/feedback and the diagrams.
- nice_x049b01b9925e5e6e_55808 -> The item asks for the area of the right triangle and the feedback computes A = 1/2 × 9 × 12 = 54. In the SVG, the base AB is labeled 9 and the vertical height BC is labeled 12, and the right angle at B is marked 90°, which aligns with the textual calculation. However, the same SVG also marks angle A as 30° and angle C as 60°. A right triangle with legs 9 and 12 has acute angles approximately 53.13° and 36.87°, not 30° and 60° (a 30-60-90 triangle would have leg ratio √3 ≈ 1.732, whereas 12/9 ≈ 1.333). Thus, the angle annotations in the diagram are inconsistent with the side lengths used in the text and feedback, creating a contradiction in the visual information relative to the numeric scenario described. Therefore, the item is inconsistent.
- nice_xdae754517ed494ca_61455 -> The number line spans from −18 at x=20 to 18 at x=420 with equally spaced ticks every 33.33 px (3 units). This makes the correct position for 0 at x=220. However, the SVG labels 0 at x=186.67, which corresponds to −3 relative to the endpoints. The marked purple point is at x=86.67 (the third tick from the left, i.e., −12), which matches the declared correct answer (−12) and the feedback statement that ticks are 3 units apart. But the misplacement of the 0 label contradicts both the endpoints and the feedback guidance to “skip-count by 3s from 0,” since using the displayed (misplaced) 0 would lead to −9 at the marked point. Therefore, the diagram is internally inconsistent with the numeric labels and the textual guidance, affecting the interpretation of the interaction.
- nice_xa44dfa8c542539df_95576 -> The SVG shows a right trapezoid with a clearly vertical left side (reinforced by a dashed vertical line) and a slanted right side. Labels “x” (placed near the left vertical side) and “y” (placed toward the right interior) appear, but no numeric values are shown and no coordinate axes are present. The feedback text, however, asserts specific numeric coordinates: “On the left side, x = −2, and on the right side, y = 5,” and justifies the correct choice by comparing 5 > −2. This introduces values (−2 and 5) that are not depicted anywhere in the diagram and cannot be inferred from it. More importantly, the feedback’s reasoning relies on the property of vertical sides sharing the same x-coordinate, yet the diagram’s right side is not vertical. Claiming a fixed coordinate on the “right side” contradicts the visual, which shows no right vertical side or vertical reference line for y. Therefore, the diagram and the textual/mathematical information are inconsistent.
- nice_x94a2f9d2a9675051_79264 -> The text and MathML state that 24 years is 75% of Mateo’s age, so 25% is 8 and 100% is 32. The SVG double number line, however, places the 75% tick at x=210 while 0% is at x=20 and 100% is at x=400. This makes 75% exactly halfway between 0% and 100% (since 210−20 = 400−210 = 190), implying 75% is located at 50% of the span. On the lower line, the age 24 is also at x=210, the midpoint between 0 and the 100% position, which would visually suggest 24 corresponds to 50% of Mateo’s age (implying 100%≈48), contradicting the stated relationship (75% corresponds to 24 and 100% is 32). For a correct 75% placement, the tick should be at x=20 + 0.75*(400−20) = 305. Thus, the diagram’s geometry is inconsistent with the textual/mathematical information and the feedback values.
- nice_xcf9144cd5aaae605_25413 -> The SVG shows a vertical number line with the top tick labeled −4 and the bottom tick labeled −10, with 7 evenly spaced ticks total. This implies 6 equal intervals covering a change of −6, so each tick represents −1. The plotted point is on the second-from-bottom tick (y≈336.67), which corresponds to −9—consistent with the correct response and the “Correct” feedback. However, the “Incorrect” feedback states that each tick mark represents three units and suggests counting from 0 by −3s (0, −3, −6, −9). The diagram does not show 0 anywhere, and its labeled endpoints (−4 to −10) and tick spacing clearly indicate 1-unit steps, not 3-unit steps. Thus, the diagram contradicts the explanatory text in the incorrect feedback.
- nice_x9ab3674cdac1422a_95615 -> Parsed item text: A right triangle has area 20 square units. The diagram labels the base as 8 and the vertical leg as x. The solution and feedback compute area = (1/2)*8*x = 20 ⇒ x = 5. The SVG shows: a right triangle with base AB labeled 8, vertical leg BC labeled x, and a right-angle mark at B (90°). However, the SVG also explicitly labels the other angles as 40° at A and 50° at C. In a right triangle with angle A = 40°, the leg ratio is x/8 = tan(40°) ≈ 0.839, implying x ≈ 6.7 and area ≈ (1/2)*8*6.7 ≈ 26.8, not 20. Conversely, area 20 with base 8 implies x = 5 and angle A ≈ arctan(5/8) ≈ 32°, not 40°. Therefore, the diagram’s given angle measures (40°, 50°, 90°) contradict the textual/feedback calculation that yields x = 5 from the stated area. Aside from the angle labels, the base and height labeling matches the feedback, but the angle annotations make the overall item inconsistent.
- nice_xbaf90abe21a83789_33593 -> Parsed item: The prompt asks to choose the equation the tape diagram represents. Choices use the fractions 3/10, x, and 4/5. The correct response and feedback assert the relation 3/10 + x = 4/5. Diagram analysis: The top tape has a 304 px wide bar partitioned into 10 equal parts (ticks every 30.4 px). A solid segment covers 91.2 px (3 segments = 3/10) and a hatched segment covers 152 px (5 segments = 5/10), implying x = 1/2. The bottom tape is a 304 px wide bar partitioned into 5 equal parts (ticks at 80.8, 141.6, 202.4, 263.2), but it is fully shaded across the entire 304 px width, representing 5/5 = 1, not 4/5. If the bottom were 4/5, it should be shaded only to the 4th tick (263.2 px). Thus, while the top bar visually encodes 3/10 + x with x equal to 5/10, the bottom bar as drawn encodes 1, contradicting the text and answer which state the total is 4/5. Therefore the SVG is inconsistent with the item’s text/MathML and feedback.
- nice_x460f8b996f5729d6_77547 -> Parsed item: The stem says, “The following data points represent how many houses Rita the Recycling Driver visited each day last week,” followed by an SVG (SVG 1). The prompt then asks the learner to select the histogram using bins that exclude the left endpoint and include the right endpoint. The feedback enumerates the intended data and binning: data values 10, 15, 20, 21, 29, 31, 35; bins (0,10], (10,20], (20,30], (30,40] with counts 1, 2, 2, 2. Diagram analysis: - SVG 1 (in the stem) shows a histogram frame with four rectangles all having height 0; there are no plotted data points or nonzero bars. This contradicts the stem text claiming it shows “the following data points.” The stem’s diagram does not represent any data. - Choice A’s SVG (SVG 2) shows bar heights 1, 2, 2, 2 across the bins 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, matching the feedback’s counts and the left-exclusive/right-inclusive bin rule. Choices B (SVG 3) and C (SVG 4) do not match those counts. Conclusion: While the correct option (A) is consistent with the feedback and MathML calculations (counts 1,2,2,2), the stem diagram is inconsistent with the stem text because it presents no data despite asserting that it shows data points. Therefore, the item contains an inconsistency affecting the interaction.
- nice_x3efa8c77671c849e_18761 -> Parsed item: A right triangular prism is shown. The prompt asks for the expression for total surface area. The item marks choice A as correct and feedback states the total surface area is the sum of two triangular faces (each area 10) and three rectangular faces with areas 15, 12, and 7, i.e., 10 + 10 + 15 + 12 + 7. SVG analysis: The diagram labels dimensions 3, 4, 5 on the triangular cross-section (consistent with a 3-4-5 right triangle) and 8 along the prism length. For a right triangular prism with triangle sides 3, 4, 5 and length 8: - Each triangular face area = (1/2)·3·4 = 6, not 10. - The three rectangular faces should have areas length × side = 8×3 = 24, 8×4 = 32, and 8×5 = 40, not 15, 12, and 7. Thus, the diagram’s dimensions (3, 4, 5, 8) contradict the numbers used in the provided correct answer and feedback (10, 10, 15, 12, 7). The expression labeled correct does not correspond to the areas implied by the SVG. Therefore the item’s visual and textual/mathematical information are inconsistent.
- nice_x934e10cf2ea0e7e4_71376 -> The item states: "Each 10×10 grid below represents one whole" and asks, "What percent of the total area is shaded?" There are two 10×10 grids (200 small squares total). From the SVGs: Grid 1 has 9 fully shaded rows (90 shaded squares) with the bottom row unshaded; Grid 2 has 8 fully shaded rows (80) plus 6 shaded in the ninth row, for 86 shaded squares. Total shaded squares across both grids = 90 + 86 = 176. The percent of the total area (out of 200 squares) that is shaded is 176/200 × 100 = 88%, not 176%. However, the qti-correct-response is 176 and the feedback says "The shaded area represents 176%." That interpretation treats each shaded square as 1% regardless of combining two grids, contradicting the prompt’s "percent of the total area" wording. Therefore, the diagrams (which imply 88% of the combined area shaded) are inconsistent with the expected answer and feedback (176%).
- nice_x270f8e23bed25b31_99306 -> The SVG shows a triangular prism with the following labeled dimensions: base of the front triangle = 8, one slanted side of the triangle = 5, and prism depth = 11. No numerical height for the triangle is provided. The declared correct answer (choice A) and its feedback treat the two triangular faces as contributing 2·8 to the surface area, implying each triangle has area 8. This is not supported by the diagram: with base 8 and no height given, the triangle’s area cannot be determined to be 8. If the drawing’s symmetry is taken at face value (suggesting an isosceles triangle with both slanted sides = 5 and base = 8), the area of each triangle would be 12 (not 8), and the rectangular faces would be 88 (8×11) and two at 55 (5×11), giving a total surface area 222, not 214. Even without assuming isosceles, the diagram’s numbers do not justify a triangle area of 8. Therefore the math in the identified correct choice and its feedback contradicts the diagram’s dimensions.
- nice_x17d286c5fd268ced_42829 -> The text and feedback state that 270 people corresponds to 125% of last year, and that from this one can derive 25% = 54 and 100% = 216 by proportional reasoning. The SVG intends to show a double number line with 0%, 25%, 50%, 100%, and 125% on the top line aligned to the bottom “People” line, with 270 labeled at the 125% tick. While the endpoint mapping (125% at 270) is shown, the percent axis is not proportionally spaced: ticks at 0%, 25%, 50%, 100%, and 125% are placed at x=20, 130, 240, 350, and 460 respectively—equal 110 px gaps. If 0% (x=20) to 125% (x=460) is linear, each 25% step should be 88 px (440/5), placing 25% at x≈108, 50% at x≈196, 75% at x≈284, and 100% at x≈372. Instead, the diagram places 100% at x=350 (where 75% should be) and omits a separate 75% tick, making the percent scale non-linear. A double number line requires proportional spacing; this misplacement contradicts the proportional relationship needed to derive 25% and 100% values from the diagram, even though the 125%→270 endpoint itself is labeled correctly. Therefore, the diagram is inconsistent with the text/MathML and could mislead responses for 25% and 100%.
- nice_xbc78fdd06685c4d8_95479 -> Parsed item asks two T/F statements about a plotted coordinate grid and includes feedback blocks. From the SVG: origin at (226.7,200); unit spacing ~15.33 px. Labeled points: Art at (0,0), Library at (1,0), Science at (3,0), Cafeteria at (-7,9). Therefore: distance(Art,Library)=1 and distance(Art,Science)=3, so the statement “Art is closer to Science than to the Library” is false. The Cafeteria coordinate (-7,9) is correct. The response declarations match this (dropdown_1=FALSE, dropdown_2=TRUE). However, the CORRECT feedback text asserts “Art is closer to Science than to the Library,” which contradicts the diagram (and the response key). Thus the visual diagram is inconsistent with the textual feedback for the first statement. The second statement and its feedback about (-7,9) are consistent.
- nice_x70d4ff682334d643_26992 -> The prompt asks for the ratio of turtles to the total number of animals. The SVG shows 4 turtles and 7 other animals, for a total of 11 animals. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 4:11. However, the keyed correct choice (A) and the feedback both state 4 for every 7, which corresponds to turtles:other animals, not turtles:total animals. The correct ratio (4:11) is not among the provided choices, and the answer key and feedback contradict the diagram and the prompt.
- nice_x24f798bd_27551 -> The item asks: “Which point is the opposite of −3 on the number line?” The response declaration marks choice C as correct, and the feedback asserts that the opposite of −3 is +3 and “which is point C.” However, the SVG number line shows the plotted points at specific labeled positions: A at 0 (x=240), B at −2 (x≈166.67), C at −3 (x=130), D at +3 (x=350), and E at −4 (x≈93.33). Therefore, the opposite of −3 (+3) corresponds to point D in the diagram, not point C. Both the declared correct response (C) and the feedback claim are inconsistent with the visual labeling in the SVG.
- nice_x46737fa249a0abbc_56803 -> The text states there are 6 sessions total, each with a different hourly rate, with all rates between $15 and $20 except for one session at $40. This implies 5 rates in the $15–$20 range and 1 rate at $40 (total of 6 rates). However, the SVG shows six cyan data points between $15 and $20 (at 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20) plus one red point at $40, for a total of 7 rates. Thus, the diagram’s number of data points contradicts the stated total of 6 sessions. All other numeric labels (15, 20, 40, etc.) align, but the count of points is inconsistent with the item text.
- nice_x6f8ee34f57d09299_68521 -> The item asks for the total surface area of a triangular prism tent and provides a single text-entry response with the correct answer 52.8 m^2. The decoded SVG shows a triangular prism with only two dimension labels: “5.2 m” (along the prism length) and “1.5 m” (the triangle height). To obtain 52.8 m^2, the triangular end must effectively have base 4.0 m and height 1.5 m (giving slant sides 2.5 m, perimeter 9 m, lateral area 46.8 m^2, plus 2 triangle areas 6 m^2, total 52.8 m^2). However, the SVG contains no label for the triangle’s base (4.0 m) or slant side (2.5 m); thus the diagram and text do not provide all dimensions needed to compute the keyed answer. Moreover, the drawn front triangle’s proportions (base/height ≈ 168.89/126.67 ≈ 1.33) correspond to a base of about 2.0 m if the height is 1.5 m, which would not yield 52.8 m^2. Therefore, the visual information is inconsistent with the numerical result and is under-specified relative to the keyed solution.
- nice_x9b0d7176a0ca687e_97064 -> Parsed item: The prompt says, "Each large grid below represents one whole." Two 10×10 grids are shown. The question asks, "What percent of the two grids is shaded?" The response is an integer with a percent sign appended, and the keyed correct response is 163. The feedback states: "There are 163 hundredths shaded across the two grids, so the shaded amount is 163%." SVG analysis: Each grid is a 10×10 array. In SVG 1, 8 full rows are shaded (y = 0 to 84), giving 80 shaded squares; the bottom two rows (y = 96, 108) are unshaded. In SVG 2, 8 full rows are shaded (y = 0 to 84) plus 3 squares in the next row (y = 96, x = 0, 12, 24), for a total of 83 shaded squares. Across both grids, 80 + 83 = 163 shaded squares. This confirms the diagram shows 163 hundredths shaded in total. Consistency check: If the question is interpreted literally as "percent of the two grids" (i.e., out of the total area of both grids), the correct percentage is (163/200)×100 = 81.5%. However, the keyed answer and feedback declare 163% (which is the percent relative to one single grid, not to the two-grid total). Moreover, the response type is integer, which would not allow entering 81.5 even if that were intended. Therefore, there is a mismatch between the question wording (percent of the two grids) and the expected answer/feedback (163%). The diagrams themselves support 163 shaded squares, but the textual question’s denominator (two grids) contradicts the keyed percent value and feedback explanation.
- nice_x1b66164ecd8c37ea_12372 -> Parsed item: The prompt asks which x-coordinate is larger, s or t, with the correct answer keyed to t (choice B). The feedback argues that (s,2) is left of (-1,4) so s < -1, and (t,4) is right of (1,2) so t > 1, hence t > s. Diagram analysis: The axes are drawn with x-axis at y=230 and y-axis at x=256.7. X-axis tick labels show that x=-2 is at 226.15 px, x=2 at 287.25 px, etc., with 2 units ≈ 30.55 px (≈15.275 px per unit). The plotted points and labels are: • A circle with text “(-1, 4)” is placed at (226.15, 166.67), which corresponds to x=-2, not x=-1 (y=166.67 correctly matches y=4). • A circle with text “(1, 2)” is placed at (287.25, 198.33), which corresponds to x=2, not x=1 (y=198.33 correctly matches y=2). The variable points are at (s,2) ≈ (180.8, 198.33) → x≈-5, and (t,4) ≈ (332.575, 166.67) → x≈5. Thus, while the ordering t > s is visually correct, the diagram is inconsistent with the numeric labels used in the feedback and the stated reference coordinates: the points labeled (-1,4) and (1,2) are actually drawn at (-2,4) and (2,2). The polygon vertices likewise reflect (-5,2), (-2,4), (5,4), (2,2), not (s,2), (-1,4), (t,4), (1,2) as described. Therefore, the visual information (axis labels and plotted positions) contradicts the textual/MathML labels for those reference points, making the item inconsistent, even though the keyed answer (t) remains logically correct.
- nice_xf66ab2278e4a05f2_28666 -> The item text asks students to use a grid showing the ages of eight students when they started kindergarten to complete a frequency table for ages 3, 4, and 5. The correct responses and feedback specify counts: age 3 → 1, age 4 → 5, age 5 → 2 (total 8 students). However, the embedded SVG is a box plot with an x‑axis labeled “Books finished” ranging from 0 to 20, not a grid of ages. The box plot’s numerical features map to continuous summary statistics (min ≈ 3, Q1 = 7, median = 10, Q3 = 13, max = 18) and do not correspond to discrete kindergarten ages of 3–5 or to eight individual data points. The visual content contradicts the textual description and the data required to answer the table, so the diagram is inconsistent with the item’s text and expected answers.
- nice_x5c4e703d0618a532_67034 -> The item asks for the area of the triangle and the feedback computes A = 1/2 × 6 × 8 = 24, implying the triangle’s perpendicular legs are 6 and 8. In the SVG, the base (AB) is labeled 6 and the vertical leg (BC) is labeled 8, and the right angle is marked at B (90°), which aligns with using those legs for area. However, the same SVG also labels the acute angles as 40° at A and 50° at C. For a right triangle with legs 6 and 8 (a 6–8–10 triangle), the acute angles should be approximately 36.87° and 53.13°, not 40° and 50°. Thus, the angle labels in the diagram are inconsistent with the side-length labels used in the text and feedback. While the area calculation itself matches the side labels, the diagram contains contradictory information (angles vs. side lengths), making the overall visual-text consistency flawed.
- nice_x6e36f052a481795a_45478 -> The SVG shows a single trapezoid with top base labeled 6, bottom base labeled 8, and height labeled 4 (with a right-angle marker and dashed left height). These dimensions match the numbers used in the feedback calculations (1/2·6·4=12, 1/2·8·4=16, total 28), so the numeric values are consistent. However, the item text states, “This diagram consists of 2 triangles,” and the table asks for areas of Triangle A and Triangle B, yet the SVG contains no internal diagonal or partition creating two triangles, nor are triangles A/B marked. Thus, the visual does not depict two triangles as claimed, creating a mismatch between the diagram and the textual description, even though the arithmetic aligns with a diagonal-based decomposition that is not shown.
- nice_x9e7e36046c2f4fa1_90586 -> The item asks for the surface area of a triangular prism and the feedback computes it using the following dimensions: prism length 20 cm; triangular base sides 13 cm, 13 cm, and 10 cm; and triangle height 12 cm (area uses base 10 and height 12). The decoded SVG, however, shows only two labels: “20 cm” (along the prism length) and “12 cm” (as the triangle’s height). There are no labels for 10 cm (triangle base) or 13 cm (the equal sides), which are explicitly used in the feedback calculations (rectangles 20×13 twice and 20×10 once, and triangles with base 10 and height 12). Because essential dimensions (10 cm and 13 cm) used in the textual/MathML solution are not present in the diagram, the visual information does not fully support the calculations given. This mismatch constitutes an inconsistency between the SVG diagram and the text/MathML solution.
- nice_x6798155e9cdba62c_53320 -> The item text and feedback establish that the whole tape represents 70 haircuts (i.e., 70 haircuts = 100%), the tape is divided into 10 equal sections (each 1/10), so each section corresponds to 7 haircuts; thus 7 haircuts = 10% and 63 haircuts (9 sections) = 90%. However, the SVG depicts a tape divided into 10 equal parts with a blue filled rectangle covering exactly 7 of the 10 sections (width 266 px out of a 380 px bar, with tick marks every 38 px). This visual strongly indicates 7/10 of the bar is filled. If the shaded portion is intended to represent the stated 70 haircuts, that implies a total of 100 haircuts (contradicting the text/feedback that 70 is the total). If instead the whole bar is 70 haircuts, then the shaded 7/10 would be 49 haircuts, not 70. Either interpretation conflicts with the textual/feedback statements and the required percentage mappings (70→100%, 7→10%, 63→90%). Therefore the diagram is inconsistent with the item’s textual/mathematical information.
- nice_x34d24c3693e1d844_46168 -> The SVG shows a number line labeled from −12 to 12 at increments of 2, with additional minor tick marks exactly halfway between the labeled (major) ticks. The blue point (and the centered “?”) are placed at the major tick labeled −8, which matches the declared correct answer (−8) and the correct feedback text. However, the incorrect feedback states, “Each tick mark represents 2 units.” This is not accurate for the provided SVG, because there are minor tick marks between the labeled ticks that represent 1-unit intervals. A more accurate statement would be that each labeled (major) tick is 2 units apart. Therefore, there is a mismatch between the diagram and the feedback text regarding tick-mark spacing, even though the point’s value is correct.
- nice_x9158eb0f2ed0f3d0_73092 -> The item asks for the area of a right triangle. The feedback computes area as (1/2)×6×8 = 24, which matches the side labels shown in the SVG: the base AB is labeled 6 and the height BC is labeled 8, and the right angle at B (90°) is marked—consistent with a right triangle and the area calculation. However, the SVG also labels the acute angles as 40° at A and 50° at C. For a right triangle with legs 6 and 8 (hypotenuse 10), the acute angles should be approximately 53.13° and 36.87°, not 40° and 50°. Thus, the diagram contains angle measures that are inconsistent with the side lengths used in the text/feedback, creating a contradiction within the item’s givens.
- nice_xfb39038c01eceb5f_47018 -> The item asks for the total surface area of the depicted right triangular prism, and the keyed correct response/feedback states 180 units^2. The SVG labels the front right triangle with base 10 and height 5 (red dashed altitude), and the prism depth is labeled 4. For a right triangular prism, total surface area = 2*(area of triangle) + (perimeter of triangle)*depth. With base b=10 and height h=5, the triangle area is (1/2)*10*5 = 25, so 2*area = 50. The hypotenuse is sqrt(10^2 + 5^2) ≈ 11.18, giving a triangle perimeter ≈ 10 + 5 + 11.18 = 26.18. With depth d=4, the lateral area is 26.18*4 ≈ 104.72, so total surface area ≈ 50 + 104.72 = 154.72 units^2, not 180. Additionally, the SVG shows a label “6.25” near a triangle side, which is inconsistent with the right triangle defined by 10 and 5 (the hypotenuse should be ≈11.18, not 6.25). Therefore, the diagram’s dimensions contradict the keyed answer and feedback value of 180 units^2.
- nice_x35e51c1d2eb8e23e_81345 -> Text and feedback specify a rectangle with upper-left (-8, 2), upper-right (-3, 2), area 20. Hence width = |-8 - (-3)| = 5 and height = 4, so lower vertices should be (-8, -2) and (-3, -2). The choice diagrams, however, are drawn with a 6-unit width. In the decoded SVG for the marked correct option (B), the rectangle is drawn from x=134.5 (x = -8) with width = 91.65 px. Given the grid spacing, 30.55 px corresponds to 2 x-units (e.g., -8 to -6), so 91.65 px = 6 units, taking the right edge to x=226.15 (x = -2), not x = -3. Vertically, it is correct (top at y=198.33 for y=2, height = 63.33 px = 4 units, bottom at y=-2), but the horizontal extent is wrong. Thus the rectangle in B represents (-8, 2) to (-2, -2), area 24, not the required (-8, 2) to (-3, -2), area 20. Similarly, the other options’ rectangles also use 91.65 px width (6 units), contradicting the coordinates stated in their comments. Therefore, the visual diagrams are inconsistent with the textual/mathematical specifications, and the declared correct answer (B) does not match the described vertices/area.
- nice_x7e48f9e909ff7a1e_53145 -> The item asks for the area of the triangle and the feedback computes A = 1/2 × base × height = 1/2 × 15 × 8 = 60. In the SVG, the horizontal base AB is explicitly labeled 15 and the vertical leg BC is labeled 8, and the right angle at B (90°) is marked, which supports using those as perpendicular base and height for area 60. However, the same SVG also labels the acute angles as 35° at A and 55° at C. For a right triangle with legs AB and BC, tan(A) should equal opposite/adjacent = BC/AB = 8/15 ≈ 0.533, which corresponds to an angle of about 28°, not 35°. Conversely, the complementary angle should be about 62°, not 55°. Therefore, the diagram’s angle measures (35°, 55°) are inconsistent with the side lengths (15, 8) used in the text and feedback. This constitutes a contradiction within the item’s provided information, even though the area calculation itself matches the labeled side lengths.

    "explanation": "The item states that the histogram and box plot display the same dataset. The histogram shows six equal-width bins across 0–300,000 km with counts [2, 8, 12, 10, 6, 2], totaling 40 vehicles. This implies that at least 32 vehicles are at or below 200,000 km (2+8+12+10=32), so the 75th percentile (Q3) must be ≤ 200,000 km. However, the box plot’s quartiles (from the SVG scale with 50,000 km per 70 px) place Q1 at ~95,000 km (x≈153), the median exactly at 140,000 km (x=216), and Q3 at ~205,000 km (x≈307), i.e., Q3 > 200,000 km. This contradicts the histogram-implied Q3 ≤ 200,000 km, so the two visuals cannot be from the same dataset as the text claims. Note that the specific numbers referenced in the prompts/feedback are otherwise supported: the histogram is appropriate to count values >200,000 km, and the box plot’s median line is at ~140,000 km. The inconsistency concerns the shared-dataset claim via the Q3 placement.",

However, the SVG then draws a full circle on top of this path with fill=\"#FFFFFF\" and stroke=\"#000000\". Because the circle is drawn after and is filled white (opaque), it completely covers the blue sector, leaving a plain white circle visible (no shaded region).

However, the same SVG also labels the acute angles as 40° at A and 50° at C. In a right triangle with legs 6 and 8, the acute angles should be approximately 53.13° and 36.87° (since tan(A) = 8/6).

The SVG supports the dimensions used for A and D: the base segments are labeled 2, 2, and 6 (sum 10) and the left vertical height is labeled 4, giving A = 20; D has base 6 and height 2, giving D = 6. Rectangle C is clearly 2×2 = 4. However, the region labeled B in the SVG is drawn as a rectangle (from x=20 to 100 and y=180 to 260) with dimensions 2 by 2, area 4; there is no diagonal shown to make it a triangle. Thus the diagram depicts 2 triangles (A and D) and 2 rectangles (B and C), contradicting the text’s “3 triangles and 1 rectangle” and the feedback’s Triangle B = 2. Consequently, the total area implied by the SVG would be 20 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 34, not the expected 32.

SVG analysis: The axes have 0 at y=230, −2 at y=261.6667, etc. The point labeled “(4, 0)” is drawn at y=230 (consistent).

    "explanation": "The SVG shows a single trapezoid with top base labeled 6, bottom base labeled 8, and height labeled 4 (with a right-angle marker and dashed left height). These dimensions match the numbers used in the feedback calculations (1/2·6·4=12, 1/2·8·4=16, total 28), so the numeric values are consistent. However, the item text states, “This diagram consists of 2 triangles,” and the table asks for areas of Triangle A and Triangle B, yet the SVG contains no internal diagonal or partition creating two triangles, nor are triangles A/B marked. Thus, the visual does not depict two triangles as claimed, creating a mismatch between the diagram and the textual description, even though the arithmetic aligns with a diagonal-based decomposition that is not shown.",

The decoded SVG, however, shows only two labels: “20 cm” (along the prism length) and “12 cm” (as the triangle’s height). There are no labels for 10 cm (triangle base) or 13 cm (the equal sides), which are explicitly used in the feedback calculations (rectangles 20×13 twice and 20×10 once, and triangles with base 10 and height 12). Because essential dimensions (10 cm and 13 cm) used in the textual/MathML solution are not present in the diagram, the visual information does not fully support the calculations given. This mismatch constitutes an inconsistency between the SVG diagram and the text/MathML solution.",

    "explanation": "The item text and feedback establish that the whole tape represents 70 haircuts (i.e., 70 haircuts = 100%), the tape is divided into 10 equal sections (each 1/10), so each section corresponds to 7 haircuts; thus 7 haircuts = 10% and 63 haircuts (9 sections) = 90%. However, the SVG depicts a tape divided into 10 equal parts with a blue filled rectangle covering exactly 7 of the 10 sections (width 266 px out of a 380 px bar, with tick marks every 38 px). This visual strongly indicates 7/10 of the bar is filled. If the shaded portion is intended to represent the stated 70 haircuts, that implies a total of 100 haircuts (contradicting the text/feedback that 70 is the total). If instead the whole bar is 70 haircuts, then the shaded 7/10 would be 49 haircuts, not 70. Either interpretation conflicts with the textual/feedback statements and the required percentage mappings (70→100%, 7→10%, 63→90%). Therefore the diagram is inconsistent with the item’s textual/mathematical information.",

The blue point (and the centered “?”) are placed at the major tick labeled −8, which matches the declared correct answer (−8) and the correct feedback text. However, the incorrect feedback states, “Each tick mark represents 2 units.” This is not accurate for the provided SVG, because there are minor tick marks between the labeled ticks that represent 1-unit intervals. A more accurate statement would be that each labeled (major) tick is 2 units apart.

However, the SVG also labels the acute angles as 40° at A and 50° at C. For a right triangle with legs 6 and 8 (hypotenuse 10), the acute angles should be approximately 53.13° and 36.87°, not 40° and 50°.

    "explanation": "The item asks for the total surface area of the depicted right triangular prism, and the keyed correct response/feedback states 180 units^2. The SVG labels the front right triangle with base 10 and height 5 (red dashed altitude), and the prism depth is labeled 4. For a right triangular prism, total surface area = 2*(area of triangle) + (perimeter of triangle)*depth. With base b=10 and height h=5, the triangle area is (1/2)*10*5 = 25, so 2*area = 50. The hypotenuse is sqrt(10^2 + 5^2) ≈ 11.18, giving a triangle perimeter ≈ 10 + 5 + 11.18 = 26.18. With depth d=4, the lateral area is 26.18*4 ≈ 104.72, so total surface area ≈ 50 + 104.72 = 154.72 units^2, not 180. Additionally, the SVG shows a label “6.25” near a triangle side, which is inconsistent with the right triangle defined by 10 and 5 (the hypotenuse should be ≈11.18, not 6.25). Therefore, the diagram’s dimensions contradict the keyed answer and feedback value of 180 units^2.",

    "explanation": "Text and feedback specify a rectangle with upper-left (-8, 2), upper-right (-3, 2), area 20. Hence width = |-8 - (-3)| = 5 and height = 4, so lower vertices should be (-8, -2) and (-3, -2). The choice diagrams, however, are drawn with a 6-unit width. In the decoded SVG for the marked correct option (B), the rectangle is drawn from x=134.5 (x = -8) with width = 91.65 px. Given the grid spacing, 30.55 px corresponds to 2 x-units (e.g., -8 to -6), so 91.65 px = 6 units, taking the right edge to x=226.15 (x = -2), not x = -3. Vertically, it is correct (top at y=198.33 for y=2, height = 63.33 px = 4 units, bottom at y=-2), but the horizontal extent is wrong. Thus the rectangle in B represents (-8, 2) to (-2, -2), area 24, not the required (-8, 2) to (-3, -2), area 20. Similarly, the other options’ rectangles also use 91.65 px width (6 units), contradicting the coordinates stated in their comments. Therefore, the visual diagrams are inconsistent with the textual/mathematical specifications, and the declared correct answer (B) does not match the described vertices/area.",

    "explanation": "The item asks for the area of the triangle and the feedback computes A = 1/2 × base × height = 1/2 × 15 × 8 = 60. In the SVG, the horizontal base AB is explicitly labeled 15 and the vertical leg BC is labeled 8, and the right angle at B (90°) is marked, which supports using those as perpendicular base and height for area 60. However, the same SVG also labels the acute angles as 35° at A and 55° at C. For a right triangle with legs AB and BC, tan(A) should equal opposite/adjacent = BC/AB = 8/15 ≈ 0.533, which corresponds to an angle of about 28°, not 35°. Conversely, the complementary angle should be about 62°, not 55°. Therefore, the diagram’s angle measures (35°, 55°) are inconsistent with the side lengths (15, 8) used in the text and feedback.
