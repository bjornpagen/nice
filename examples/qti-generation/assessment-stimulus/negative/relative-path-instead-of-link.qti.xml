    <h2>Key points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gregor Mendel studied inheritance of traits in pea plants. He proposed a model where pairs of "heritable elements," or <strong>genes</strong>, specified traits.</li>
      <li>Genes come in different versions, or <strong>alleles</strong>. A <strong>dominant</strong> allele hides a <strong>recessive</strong> allele and determines the organism&apos;s appearance.</li>
      <li>When an organism makes gametes, each gamete receives just one gene copy, which is selected randomly. This is known as the <strong>law of segregation</strong>.</li>
      <li>A <strong>Punnett square</strong> can be used to predict <strong>genotypes</strong> (allele combinations) and <strong>phenotypes</strong> (observable traits) of offspring from genetic crosses.</li>
      <li>A <strong>test cross</strong> can be used to determine whether an organism with a dominant phenotype is homozygous or heterozygous.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Today, we know that many of people&apos;s characteristics, from hair color to height to risk of diabetes, are influenced by genes. We also know that genes are the way parents pass characteristics on to their children (including things like dimples, or—in the case of me and my father—a terrible singing voice). In the last hundred years, we&apos;ve come to understand that genes are actually pieces of DNA that are found on <a href="/science/biology/classical-genetics/chromosomal-basis-of-genetics/v/boveri-sutton-chromosome-theory">chromosomes</a> and <a href="/science/biology/classical-genetics/molecular-basis-of-genetics-tutorial/v/alleles-and-genes">specify proteins</a>.</p>
    <p>But did we always know those things? Not by a long shot! About <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>150</mn></math> years ago, a monk named <a href="/science/biology/classical-genetics/mendelian--genetics/a/mendel-and-his-peas">Gregor Mendel</a> published a paper that first proposed the existence of genes and presented a model for how they were inherited. Mendel&apos;s work was the first step on a long road, involving many hard-working scientists, that&apos;s led to our present understanding of genes and what they do.</p>
    <p>In this article, we’ll trace the experiments and reasoning that led Mendel to formulate his model for the inheritance of single genes.</p>
