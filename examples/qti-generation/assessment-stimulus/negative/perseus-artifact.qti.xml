  This XML is intentionally malformed to serve as a negative example.
  REASON FOR BEING BAD: It contains a raw Perseus widget artifact: `[[☃ grapher 1]]`.
  These artifacts are specific to Khan Academy's Perseus renderer and are not valid in QTI.
  They MUST be completely removed or converted into a static representation (like an image) during conversion.
  Leaving them in will cause the QTI API to fail validation.
