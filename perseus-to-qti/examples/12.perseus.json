Thousands of cargo ships move across the ocean from port to port, every moment of every day. The shipping of goods plays a significant role in the world [[☃ definition 4]]. However, shipping often has harmful effects on the environment. Cargo ships use fuels that release harmful gasses, warming the planet. But there’s a solution to this problem. The world needs to develop [[☃ definition 1]] shipping [[☃ definition 2]], a key weapon in the war against climate change. \n\n###The problem with cargo ships\n\n\n2. [[☃ definition 3]] like oil are burned to create the energy that powers cargo ships across the sea. When fossil fuels are burned, they release gasses that trap heat in the air around the Earth, warming the planet. Unfortunately, cargo ships are responsible for about 3% of the gasses that are the main cause of climate change. \n\n3. Today’s cargo ships also release tiny bits of soot into the air, which lead to health problems for humans and animals. Besides contaminating the environment, soot may also trap heat in the air, making the climate crisis worse. \n\n\n###What are green shipping corridors?\n\n4. The word “green” is often used to describe something that helps protect the environment. So, green shipping corridors are passageways across the sea that are reserved for green shipping vessels, which are cargo ships that run on fuels and resources less likely to harm the environment. The cargo ships would run on sources of energy that don’t create soot or release gasses responsible for climate change. These sources include everything from man-made renewable liquid fuels to wind. I argue that they are the best way forward for the shipping industry, not to mention the planet.\n\n\n###Realizing what’s possible\n\n\n5. Some argue that green shipping corridors aren’t a sensible solution. They maintain that it would be too difficult to build green cargo ships. \n\n\n6. However, the process has already begun. In 2023, the world’s first green cargo ship entered the ocean. The ship is powered by a green fuel made from food waste collected at landfills. The company who owns the ship, Maersk, has committed to only purchasing new ships that can use green fuels. In addition, Maersk is rebuilding parts of its old ships so they can run on green fuels, too. \n\n\n7. Around the world, the shipping industry is feeling pressure to follow companies like Maersk. That’s because, in 2015, most of the countries in the world entered the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is a promise these countries made to make changes that will reduce the effects of climate change. Without changes to the way cargo ships use fuel and solutions like green shipping corridors, the goals of the agreement can’t be met. \n\n\n8. Slowly, the shipping industry is realizing what’s possible—and what’s necessary. On January 28, 2022, the ports of Los Angeles, California and Shanghai, China, along with a group of international cities, made an announcement. The world’s first green shipping corridor is going to be created between Los Angeles and Shanghai. The Pacific trading route between these two large ports is one of the world’s busiest. This new shipping route represents a model the rest of the world can use. \n\n\n###Including everyone\n\n\n9. A green shipping corridor between two giant ports is great news. However, green shipping corridors must include everyone. Already, small Pacific island nations are voicing concern that their ports won’t be included in green shipping corridors. Yet they will still depend on the goods delivered to them on the current routes.\n\n\n10. Many of these islands are doing their part to fight climate change. For example, the island nation of Tuvalu has committed to a serious green energy plan for its population. The Marshall Islands use a wind-powered cargo ship to move between their ports. \n\n\n11. To be fair, green shipping corridors must be expanded and they must include everyone. After all, climate change affects everyone, and so this is a battle we must fight together.\n\n[[☃ explanation 1]]=====\n**A cargo ship engineer wants to make the following argument:**\n\n>**Green shipping corridors are already possible with current technology.**\n\n**Which two pieces of evidence from the text would best support their argument?**\n\n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n",
