Humans have taken over most of the lands where lions used to live. Hunters kill lions for their fur. And [[☃ definition 5]] farmers hoping to keep their [[☃ definition 7]] safe also hunt lions.\n\nWhen scientist Leela Hazzah moved to Kenya, she spoke to many Maasai, who felt frustrated that they were often left out of local [[☃ definition 4]] programs. Those conversations inspired an idea: What if Maasai warriors were hired to protect lions? Soon after, Hazzah created Lion Guardians. The group uses [[☃ definition 3]] and Maasai [[☃ definition 2]] to find and protect lions in the area. Today, 40 Lion Guardians protect more than 100 lions from [[☃ definition 1]] hunting. \n\n**Based on the information in the text, what are *two* reasons why there are so few lions today?**\n\n[[☃ radio 1]]\n\n[[☃ explanation 1]] ",
