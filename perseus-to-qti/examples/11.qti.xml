        <p>In 1950, 400,000 lions <abbr title="roamed (ROHMD): walked around">roamed</abbr> Africa. Today, fewer than 40,000 are left. Why? There are a few reasons. Humans have taken over most of the lands where lions used to live. Hunters kill lions for their fur. And <abbr title="Maa·sai (mah-SY): group of people who live in East Africa">Maasai</abbr> farmers hoping to keep their <abbr title="live·stock (LIVE-stahk): farm animals like cows and sheep">livestock</abbr> safe also hunt lions.</p>
        <p>When scientist Leela Hazzah moved to Kenya, she spoke to many Maasai, who felt frustrated that they were often left out of local <abbr title="con·ser·va·tion (kon-ser-VAY-shun): protecting nature and animals">conservation</abbr> programs. Those conversations inspired an idea: What if Maasai warriors were hired to protect lions? Soon after, Hazzah created Lion Guardians. The group uses <abbr title="tech·nol·o·gy (tehk-NAW-luh-jee): scientific knowledge and tools">technology</abbr> and Maasai <abbr title="ways to find and follow animals or people in nature">tracking techniques</abbr> to find and protect lions in the area. Today, 40 Lion Guardians protect more than 100 lions from <abbr title="il·le·gal (ih-LEE-gul): against the law">illegal</abbr> hunting.</p>
