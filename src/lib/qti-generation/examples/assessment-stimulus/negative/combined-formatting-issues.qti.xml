  This XML is intentionally malformed to serve as a negative example.
  REASON FOR BEING BAD: This example combines multiple formatting issues:
  1. The opening <qti-assessment-stimulus> tag is split across multiple lines with inconsistent indentation
  2. Images are not wrapped in paragraph tags
  3. Overall formatting is inconsistent
  These issues were commonly found in the original conversions and needed to be fixed for proper QTI compliance.

        <p><em>Cities forever changed the way humans lived. Cities connected the people living in them to one another, to surrounding farmland, and to people in other cities.</em></p>
        <h2>The first cities</h2>
        <p>Like agriculture, the world's first cities developed independently in different parts of the world at different times.</p>
