Judges are not free to overlook plain [[☃ definition 1]] commands on the strength of nothing more than suppositions about intentions or guesswork about expectations. In Title VII, Congress adopted broad language making it illegal for an employer to rely on an employee’s sex when deciding to fire that employee.  We do not hesitate to recognize today a necessary consequence of that legislative choice: An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.\n\n**What method of constitutional interpretation did Justice Gorsuch use in this opinion?**\n\n[[☃ radio 1]]",
