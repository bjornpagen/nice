            <p>In 1950, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>400,000</mn></math> lions <abbr title="roamed (ROHMD): walked around">roamed</abbr> Africa. Today, fewer than <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>40,000</mn></math> are left. Why? There are a few reasons. Humans have taken over most of the lands where lions used to live. Hunters kill lions for their fur. And <abbr title="Maa·sai (mah-SY): group of people who live in East Africa">Maasai</abbr> farmers hoping to keep their <abbr title="live·stock (LIVE-stahk): farm animals like cows and sheep">livestock</abbr> safe also hunt lions.</p>
            <p>When scientist Leela Hazzah moved to Kenya, she spoke to many Maasai, who felt frustrated that they were often left out of local <abbr title="con·ser·va·tion (kon-ser-VAY-shun): protecting nature and animals">conservation</abbr> programs. Those conversations inspired an idea: What if Maasai warriors were hired to protect lions? Soon after, Hazzah created Lion Guardians. The group uses <abbr title="tech·nol·o·gy (tehk-NAW-luh-jee): scientific knowledge and tools">technology</abbr> and Maasai <abbr title="ways to find and follow animals or people in nature">tracking techniques</abbr> to find and protect lions in the area. Today, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>40</mn></math> Lion Guardians protect more than <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>100</mn></math> lions from <abbr title="il·le·gal (ih-LEE-gul): against the law">illegal</abbr> hunting.</p>

            <qti-prompt>Based on the information in the text, what are two reasons why there are so few lions today?</qti-prompt>
            <qti-simple-choice identifier="A">
                Hunters illegally kill lions for their teeth and claws.
                <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier="FEEDBACK-INLINE" identifier="A">This isn't a reason mentioned in the text. The text says, "Hunters kill lions for their fur," not their teeth and claws. Top tip! We can forget information only seconds after we read it. Go back to check the text for answers!</qti-feedback-inline>
            </qti-simple-choice>
            <qti-simple-choice identifier="B">
                Farmers hunt lions to protect their animals.
                <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier="FEEDBACK-INLINE" identifier="B">This is one of the best choices. The text says that "Maasai farmers hoping to keep their livestock safe also hunt lions." So one of the reasons why there are so few lions today is because farmers hunt them to keep their animals safe.</qti-feedback-inline>
            </qti-simple-choice>
            <qti-simple-choice identifier="C">
                The Lion Guardians use technology and traditional Maasai tracking techniques.
                <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier="FEEDBACK-INLINE" identifier="C">This isn't a reason why there are so few lions today. The text tells us that the Lion Guardians "protect lions." Protecting lions wouldn't make it so that there were fewer lions.</qti-feedback-inline>
            </qti-simple-choice>
            <qti-simple-choice identifier="D">
                Humans have taken over many areas where lions used to live.
                <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier="FEEDBACK-INLINE" identifier="D">This is one of the best choices. The text says, "There are a few reasons" why there are fewer lions than there used to be. It then explains, "Humans have taken over most of the lands where lions used to live." So there aren't many lions today because they don't have much space left to live in.</qti-feedback-inline>

                <qti-feedback-inline outcome-identifier="FEEDBACK-INLINE" identifier="E">This isn't a reason why there are so few lions today. This tells us that there are fewer lions than there used to be, but it doesn't give a reason why that is.</qti-feedback-inline>

                <p><strong>Excellent!</strong> You correctly identified the two reasons directly stated in the text: habitat loss due to human expansion and hunting by farmers to protect livestock.</p>

                <p><strong>Not quite.</strong> Reread the first paragraph carefully. The author explicitly lists three reasons for the decline in the lion population. Your two choices must match the reasons given in the text.</p>
