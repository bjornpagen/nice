            <p>Text 1: The mystery of the golden frog</p>
            <ol>
                <li>For hundreds of years, golden frogs thrived in Panama's misty, mountain forests. Panama's <abbr title="Anton Valley, a town in Panama">El Valle de Antón</abbr> once echoed with the croaks of golden frogs. Today, these frogs have disappeared from the wild. What killed them? It took scientists years to figure it out.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A national symbol</p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li>The golden frog is a treasured symbol of Panama, believed to bring good luck and fortune. You'll find its image everywhere—on lottery tickets, statues, jewelry, and souvenirs. Panama even celebrates a National Golden Frog Day.</li>
                <li>Respect and appreciation for the frog comes from local <abbr title="in·dig·e·nous (in-DIJ-uh-nuhs): native to an area">Indigenous</abbr> traditions and folktales, where it's seen as a sacred animal. Indigenous people buried statues of golden frogs with the dead to bring good luck in the afterlife. They were as deeply connected to Panamanian cultures as they were to Panama's <abbr title="eco·sys·tems (EE-koh-sis-tems): communities of living things along with their environment">ecosystems</abbr>. But in the 1990s, the frogs began to vanish.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>An unknown killer</p>
            <ol start="4">
                <li>In <em>The Case of the Vanishing Frogs</em>, Sandra Markle explains:
                    <blockquote><p>Scientists first realized that golden frogs were dying out in 1996. That year biologist Karen Lips went to Panama. She visited the cool, misty, high mountain forest of Fortuna Forest Reserve in Chiriqui Province. […] She heard few frog voices. Worse, when Lips started searching for frogs, most of the ones she found were dead. She collected the bodies and soon had fifty of them. Finding so many dead frogs was surprising. In the damp forest, a dead frog quickly decomposes. Or it's eaten by other animals, such as wasps. So finding lots of dead frogs meant that the frogs must have died recently.</p></blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>Shocked by her discovery in Fortuna Forest, Lips began investigating possible causes of the frogs' deaths. She wondered if pollution was affecting the frog population. However, the frogs' habitat was high in the mountains and so far from any nearby factories that no polluted water flowed there. When she looked into climate change, she found that rainfall and temperature conditions were exactly the same as when the frogs were thriving. So that wasn't the answer either.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>An answer at last</p>
            <ol start="6">
                <li>After examining frogs under a microscope, Lips found that most of the dead frogs had peeling skin with strange sacs underneath. Working with <abbr title="pa·thol·o·gists (puh-THOL-uh-jists): medical professionals who study tissue from bodies to investigate and diagnose diseases">pathologists</abbr>, she identified the cause: a new fungus called <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, also known as <em>Bd</em>. This fungus releases <abbr title="poisonous substances">toxins</abbr> that break down the frogs' skin, causing severe <abbr title="de·hy·dra·tion (dee-hy-DRAY-shun): lack of water in the body">dehydration</abbr> and heart failure. Identifying the fungus was just the start. Now scientists had to find a way to save the frogs.</li>
                <li>Scientists collected many of the healthy frogs in an effort to combat the effects of the rapidly spreading and deadly fungus. In zoos and <abbr title="re·ha·bil·i·ta·tion (ree-huh-bih-luh-TAY-shun): the process of restoring health">rehabilitation</abbr> centers, the frogs were placed in controlled environments where scientists could monitor their health, breed them to increase the overall population, and study potential treatments for <em>Bd</em> infection.</li>
                <li>Unfortunately, scientists haven't figured out how to <abbr title="erad·i·cate (ih-RAD-i-kate): completely eliminate">eradicate</abbr> <em>Bd</em>. So despite their efforts, they were unable to prevent the <abbr title="ex·tinc·tion (ik-STINGK-shun): complete disappearance">extinction</abbr> of the golden frogs in the wild. However, many golden frogs now reside and thrive in captivity across the world. And there is still hope that with ongoing advancements in science and careful breeding and rehabilitation programs, these frogs may one day return to their natural habitats.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Text 2: A world without amphibians</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Have you ever wondered what would happen if frogs, toads, and salamanders disappeared from the world? These creatures may be small, but their role in nature is massive—and their decline could have devastating consequences. Without <abbr title="am·phib·i·ans (am-FIB-ee-uhns): group of cold-blooded animals that live both on land and in water">amphibians</abbr>, entire ecosystems could collapse. That's because amphibians control insect populations, support food chains, maintain healthy <abbr title="a·quat·ic (uh-KWAT-ik): related to water">aquatic</abbr> habitats, and even help prevent the spread of disease. For example, frogs eat large numbers of mosquitoes, which can carry deadly diseases like malaria and dengue fever.</li>
                <li>Sadly, amphibians are in danger. Over <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>40</mn></math>% of amphibian species are now at risk of extinction. One of the biggest threats to amphibians is habitat loss due to human activity. Amphibians live in wetlands, ponds, and streams, and the expansion of cities and farms destroys or pollutes these habitats. Take the California tiger salamander. Fewer than <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>1,000</mn></math> of these salamanders remain in areas where <abbr title="the uncontrolled spread of cities into surrounding natural areas">urban sprawl</abbr> and agriculture have wiped out much of their habitat.</li>
                <li>Climate change also plays a major role in the decline of amphibians. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and moisture because their skin absorbs both water and oxygen. As a result, shifting conditions can easily harm them. In Australia, for example, rising temperatures and long <abbr title="periods without rain">droughts</abbr> have dried up many wetlands, destroying frogs' natural habitats.</li>
                <li>Another major threat to amphibians comes from disease. <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, a deadly fungus, has wiped out amphibian populations around the world. The fungus attacks their skin, which they need to breathe and absorb moisture. This has led to the extinction of species like the Panamanian golden frog in the wild.</li>
                <li>To protect amphibians and preserve the health of our ecosystems, we must take immediate action. This includes protecting wetlands and natural habitats from development and pollution, combating climate change, and supporting research to fight amphibian diseases. By taking these steps, we can give amphibians a fighting chance.</li>

                <p><strong>Correct!</strong> You made an excellent inference. The text emphasizes that the golden frog is "a treasured symbol of Panama" that appears on lottery tickets, jewelry, and souvenirs, and is celebrated with a National Golden Frog Day. Since the frog is "deeply connected to Panamanian cultures," its loss would represent a significant cultural loss.</p>

                <p><strong>Not quite.</strong> An inference requires combining information from the text with your background knowledge. Look for clues about the golden frog's cultural significance to Panama—the text mentions it's a "treasured symbol" that appears everywhere and is "deeply connected to Panamanian cultures." What would losing such an important symbol mean?</p>
