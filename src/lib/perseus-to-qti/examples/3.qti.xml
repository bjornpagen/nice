                <p><strong>Correct!</strong> During Era 3 (6,000 BCE to 700 CE), societies participated in regional trade networks. Major networks emerged in Afro-Eurasia and Mesoamerica, connecting neighboring societies but not yet spanning the globe.</p>

            <qti-content-body>
                <p><strong>Not quite.</strong> Think about the scale of trade during this early era. While trade was expanding beyond purely local exchanges, it had not yet reached a global scale. Regional networks connected neighboring societies, particularly in Afro-Eurasia and Mesoamerica.</p>
