XP System Brainlift

- Purpose
  - We use an XP (eXperience Point) system to track student progress because it is a universal metric that works regardless of subject, grade, course, and it includes all the sub-metrics (time, lessons, accuracy, speedbumps) that we care about.
  - XP is the #1 metric kids care about because XP is tied to the rewards they receive.  This makes it a powerful motivational tool to encourage the right behaviors, but it also makes it ripe for "gaming".  Our XP system needs to be hardened against "gaming" so that no XP is awarded unless students have actually learned.
  - This brainlift describes the XP System that motivates the correct behaviors, and discourages the wrong ones.
- SpikyPOVs on XP
  - 1XP = 1Min. The most important principle is that 1XP should represent 1 minute of focused quality work.
  - Our XP System is similar to MathAcademy's XP system, except for one big difference, we don't award partial XP for accuracies below 80% because we don't believe the student has learned at the rigor necessary for a mastery based system.
  - There are two kinds of XP: expected, and awarded
  - Expected XP
    - Expected XP belongs on each piece of course content and is student independent.  Expected XP is the same no matter which student is engaging with the content
    - Manually "speed running" (timing a motivated human as they complete material correctly) is the best way to set expected XP for each lesson.
      - Averages over or under reward almost every lesson.
      - Using student actuals to set expected XP always overstates because it includes students who aren't using the app correctly.
  - Awarded XP
    - Awarded XP is the  the actual amount given to the student after completing an activity
    - Awarded** **XP** **is** independent** of the student's actual mins spent on the activity. It is based on expected XP and the student's behavior - accuracy, speedbumps - in the activity.
    - Do NOT award XP for passive activities alone (e.g. articles, videos).  Wait until the learning is verified by a pp100 lesson quiz or test to award XP for the time spent in the article or video, or else students will collect XP without learning anything.
    - DO award XP at the point in time where you can verify that real learning happened at the right rigor (typically after completing pp100 lessons, or 80% on quizzes or tests)
      - DO include time taken to read the article and watch the video if those activities are required to learn.
      - We don't award XP for quizzes and tests below 80% accuracy
      - We award a 25% accuracy bonus for "perfect" 100% accuracy
    - Award Full XP (in the amount of the number of minutes a student using the app correctly would spend) when A) the learning occurred and B) there were no speed bumps (no skipping, rushing, guessing)
    - Award Bonus XP (+20 - 25% on top of Full) for 100% accuracy because it encourages careful work on exercises.
    - Award only Partial XP for mastery that was inefficient. When A) the material was learned at the right rigor but B) there were speed bumps (skipping the worked examples, skipping the wrong answer explanations, rushing, or guessing) that brought down the accuracy and caused the lesson to take longer than it should..
    - Award 0 XP when the A) mastery didn't happen B) a sincere effort was put in.
    - Takeaway XP (award negative XP) when A) the material was not learned at the right level of rigor and B) there was an insincere effort (student, cheated, rushed, guessed, or gamed there way through the lesson without learning it)

          - Not Mastered
            - incomplete or complete without mastery accuracy
        - What kind of effort did the student put in? focused, wasteful, insincere
          - Focused
            - no speed bumps

  - MathAcademy Original Design
    - Intent of XP
      - Math Academy's XP (eXperience Points) system is a comprehensive progress tracking mechanism designed to measure and reward student learning.
      - One XP is designed to represent approximately one minute of focused effort on the system.
      - XP can be awarded on a sliding scale based on student performance.  Students get full XP for a lesson if they get most answers correct, partial credit if they get some correct, bonus XP for 100%. 
      - In some cases, the system may assign negative XP to discourage rushing or guessing behaviors.
    - Core XP Mechanics
      - Basic Measurement
        - One XP roughly equals one minute of focused effort[1](https://mathacademy.com/how-it-works)[2](https://www.mathacademy.com/faq)
        - XP is awarded for correct answers and successful task completion[2](https://www.mathacademy.com/faq)
        - Students can earn XP through lessons, reviews, multistep problems, and quizzes[3](https://www.howtohomeschool.com/curriculum-directory/math/math-academy)
      - Daily Goals and Progress
        - Students have adjustable daily XP targets[1](https://mathacademy.com/how-it-works)
        - The system awards bonus XP for perfect scores[1](https://mathacademy.com/how-it-works)
        - Quizzes are assigned every 150 XP to assess mastery[1](https://mathacademy.com/how-it-works)
        - Parents and teachers can modify XP requirements for breaks and vacations[2](https://www.mathacademy.com/faq)
    - Performance Metrics
      - Sustainable Rates
        - Maximum sustainable rate is approximately 50-60 XP per day[5](https://www.justinmath.com/what-is-the-highest-sustainable-daily-xp-on-math-academy/)
        - The highest recorded monthly total was 5,728 XP (about 200 XP/day)[5](https://www.justinmath.com/what-is-the-highest-sustainable-daily-xp-on-math-academy/)
        - Typical school program students achieve 40-50 XP per school day[5](https://www.justinmath.com/what-is-the-highest-sustainable-daily-xp-on-math-academy/)
      - Scoring System
        - Full XP is awarded for mostly correct answers in lessons[2](https://www.mathacademy.com/faq)
        - Partial credit is given for partially correct work[2](https://www.mathacademy.com/faq)
        - Negative XP can be assigned for rushing or guessing behaviors[2](https://www.mathacademy.com/faq)
        - The cutoff for earning XP is **60% accuracy.** Below 60%, students start incurring negative XP but the algorithm gets tricky as it involves anti-patterns, number of questions, task duration, etc.
        - 100% accuracy = bonus XP. +2pts on 'small' tasks; +3pts on 'large' tasks.
        - 90 <> 99% accuracy = full (100%) XP
        - 67 <> 89% accuracy = most (75%) XP
        - 60 <> 66% accuracy = a little (50%) XP
        - < 60% accuracy = zero or negative XP
        - I used o3 on ~1200 tasks: [https://chatgpt.com/share/](https://chatgpt.com/share/6873a8d1-d51c-8001-a168-631d708088e0)[6873a8d1-d51c-8001-a168-](https://chatgpt.com/share/6873a8d1-d51c-8001-a168-631d708088e0)[631d708088e0](https://chatgpt.com/share/6873a8d1-d51c-8001-a168-631d708088e0)

  - The XP decision
    - Creating the core learning metric for TimeBack was the most important decision we made. It is a difficult balance of tradeoffs.  Here is how we made it and the tradeoffs:
      - Minutes - clear and simple to measure, but ignores the depth or quality of the learning
      - Accuracy - gives a good indication of when learning is happening or not happening, but ignores the quantity of learning.  Also, when learning is not happening, accuracy can't explain why.  
      - Lessons - Great metric for tracking progress (e.g. course completion percentage) but what a completed lesson is, and how long it should take to complete, varies so wildly across different subjects, apps, and courses that it makes it too complicated for students.  Also, tests aren't taken into account.
      - Waste - identifies inefficiencies that students can easily correct to boost learning efficiency, but doesn't tell us how much learning actually occurred.
      - We needed a metric that combines the time-on-task and the proof-of-learning into one figure that is easy for students, guides, parents to understand.  We chose XP.
      - XP (Experience Points) is well known video game term.  It is a measure of progress and leveling up.  
      - 1 XP = 1 min of productive learning.
      - There are downsides of an XP system
        - Estimating XP values is subjective and labor-intensive, risking inconsistencies. Students might feel frustrated or demotivated if values are off.  
        - Despite penalties, students might "farm" easy XP or exploit loopholes.
        - Tracking bonuses/penalties and integrating app-specific rules add complexity.
