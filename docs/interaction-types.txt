3.2 Interaction Types
All QTI v2.2 interaction types are included in QTI 3. However, the interaction elements have been renamed to reflect a web component-friendly syntax which will enable QTI processors to render ItemBody interaction content - should they choose to do so – with web components, and without having to apply further interaction transformations.

The QTI 3 interaction web components-friendly vocabulary introduces the "qti-" prefix on every QTI element. Furthermore, camelcase elements and attributes are replaced with all-lowercase elements/attributes with hyphen separators. See the example below of a choice interaction with the QTI 3 web components-friendly vocabulary.

Example: qti-choice-interaction

<qti-assessment-item>
  . . .
  <qti-item-body>
    <p>Look at the text in the picture.</p>
    <p><img src="images/sign.png" alt="NEVER LEAVE LUGGAGE UNATTENDED" /></p>
    <qti-choice-interaction max-choices="1" response-identifier="RESPONSE">
      <qti-prompt>What does it say?</qti-prompt>
      <qti-simple-choice identifier="A">You must stay with your luggage at all times.</qti-simple-choice>
      <qti-simple-choice identifier="B">Do not let someone else look after your luggage.</qti-simple-choice>
      <qti-simple-choice identifier="C">Remember your luggage when you leave.</qti-simple-choice>
    </qti-choice-interaction>
  </qti-item-body>
</qti-assessment-item>
In another example (a hotspot interaction), note how the img element is considered an HTML element - and therefore not prefixed by "qti-" - even though it is a sub-element of an interaction.

Example: qti-hotspot-interaction

<qti-assessment-item>
  . . .
  <qti-item-body>
    <p>The picture below illustrates four of the most popular destinations for
    air travelers arriving in the United Kingdom: London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
    Please choose all of the cities Northof London.</p>
    <qti-hotspot-interaction max-choices="0" response-identifier="RESPONSE">

      <img src="ukair.png" height="280" width="206" alt="UK Map" />

      <qti-hotspot-choice identifier="A" shape="circle" coords="77,115,10" />
      <qti-hotspot-choice identifier="B" shape="circle" coords="118,184,10" />
      <qti-hotspot-choice identifier="C" shape="circle" coords="150,235,10" />
      <qti-hotspot-choice identifier="D" shape="circle" coords="96,114,10" />
    </qti-hotspot-interaction>
  </qti-item-body>
</qti-assessment-item>
QTI 3 includes the following standardized interactions:

Choice (qti-choice-interaction): presents a set of choices to the candidate. The candidate's task is to select one or more of the choices, up to a maximum number of choices allowed. (See Section 3.2.2 )
Text Entry (qti-text-entry-interaction): an inline interaction that accepts text from the candidate. (See Section 3.2.3 )
Extended Text(qti-extended-text-interaction): a block interaction that allows the candidate to enter an extended amount of text.
Gap Match (qti-gap-match-interaction): a block interaction that contains a number of gaps that the candidate can fill from an associated set of choices.
Hot Spot(qti-hotspot-interaction): a graphical interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to select one or more of the areas (hotspots).
Hot Text (qti-hot-text-interaction): presents a set of choices to the candidate represented as selectable runs of text embedded within a surrounding context, such as a passage of text.
Inline Choice (qti-inline-choice-interaction): an inline interaction that presents the user with a set of choices, each of which is an answer option (usually text). The candidate's task is to select one of the choices.
Match (qti-match-interaction): a block interaction that presents candidates with two sets of choices and allows them to create associations between pairs of choices in the two sets, but not between pairs of choices in the same set.
Order (qti-order-interaction): the candidate's task is to reorder the choices, the order in which the choices are displayed initially is significant.
Graphic Order(qti-graphic-order-interaction): A graphic order interaction is a graphic interaction with a corresponding set of hotspot choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to impose an ordering on the areas (hotspots).
Associate (qti-associate-interaction): a block interaction that presents candidates with a number of choices and allows them to create associations between them.
Graphic Associate (qti-graphic-associate-interaction): a graphic interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to associate the areas (hotspots) with each other.
Graphic Gap Match (qti-graphic-gap-match-interaction): a graphical interaction with a set of gaps that are defined as areas (hotspots) of the graphic image and an additional set of gap choices that are defined outside the image. The candidate must associate the gap choices with the gaps in the image and be able to review the image with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices.
Media (qti-media-interaction): allows more control over the way the candidate interacts with a time-based media object and allows the number of times the media object was experienced to be reported in the value of the associated response variable.
Position Object (qti-position-object-interaction): consists of a single image which must be positioned on another graphic image (the stage) by the candidate.
Select Point (qti-select-point-interaction): a graphic interaction in which the candidate's task is to select one or more points.
Slider (qti-slider-interaction): presents the candidate with a control for selecting a numerical value between a lower and upper bound.
Upload(qti-upload-interaction): allows the candidate to upload a pre-prepared file representing their response.
Drawing(qti-drawing-interaction): allows the candidate to use drawing tools provided by the delivery system to modify a given graphical image (the canvas). The result is a file in the same format as the original image.
Custom(qti-custom-interaction) and Portable Custom (qti-portable-custom-interaction): allow the item author to present an interaction with a custom user interface and behavior, supported by, respectively, delivery engine-specific or author-provided code.  Portable Custom Interactions (PCIs) allow the Javascript code implementing the interaction to be made available to delivery systems, with a standard Javascript interface, offering the potential for making PCIs more interoperable and portable between conforming delivery engines.
End Attempt (qti-end-attempt-interaction): is a special interaction which immediately ends the current attempt on an assessment item.  It may be used, for example, to allow the candidate to request a hint or model solution, or in an adaptive item to let the candidate display feedback or to move to the next in a series of interactions in the item.
Each of the interactions described in the following sections can contain sub-elements and attributes. For full descriptions of these features, see the QTI 3 Information Model document.

3.2.1 Interoperability and Utilizing Shared Vocabularies
Previous versions of QTI lack specificity with respect to interaction presentation, styling, and behavior. Consequently, QTI authoring systems and delivery systems have implemented interactions with custom presentation/behavior definitions, which in turn have become an impediment to interoperability. To improve interaction presentation/behavior interoperability, QTI 3 introduces, "shared vocabularies" that describe more fine-grained presentation control and more semantically-explicit styling and behaviors.

There are two primary mechanisms of the QTI 3 interaction shared vocabularies:

An interaction's class attribute, and
An interaction's " data-" attributes.
In order to prevent collisions with existing classes, the QTI 3 interaction shared vocabularies  use classes with the "qti-" prefix.

Although the class and " data-" attributes already exist in QTI 2.2, the shared vocabularies explicitly define how to use these attributes to achieve certain agreed-upon rendered presentations. By agreeing to implement interaction styling and behaviors according to the definitions of the shared vocabularies, interaction interoperability may be greatly improved.

Implementers of custom presentations/behaviors should avoid using classes with the "qti-" prefix, and should also avoid using the QTI 3 established "data-" attributes from the shared vocabularies. Over time, it is the expectation that the shared vocabularies will evolve as common use-cases emerge.

When using classes that indicate that the presentation of content should be horizontal (qti-orientation-horizontal, qti-choices-stacking-2, etc.), it can force some of the choices outside the single width of the viewing portal, which can be problematic for candidates. For low-vision candidates using magnification (or text-appearance → font-size or word-spacing), the likelihood of horizontal scrolling is increased. When choices are placed off-screen, candidates can accidentally disregard the choices, candidates are required to use additional working memory to respond to the item, and it adds significant time for low-vision candidates.

If the candidate is known to have low-vision, and choices could be displayed beyond the width of a single viewport, presentation systems should consider presenting the choices vertically.

The 1EdTech QTI 3 Standardized Shared Vocabulary and CSS Classes document enumerates and details all of the currently adopted shared vocabulary.

3.2.2 Choice Interaction
The ChoiceInteraction.Type (qti-choice-interaction) interaction presents a collection of choices to the candidate. The candidate's task is to select one or more of the choices, up to a maximum of max-choices. The interaction is always initialized with no choices selected.

The ChoiceInteraction.Type must be bound to a response variable with a base-type of identifier and single or multiple cardinality.

In a choice interaction, it is considered best practice to use the shared vocabulary related to the layout of choices instead of using the optional orientation attribute. If both the shared vocabulary classes and the orientation attribute are used, the shared vocabulary classes take precedence over the orientation attribute value (including the default value of "vertical").

ChoiceInteraction Attributes (element: qti-choice-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
max-choices	optional	Non-negative integer	1
min-choices	optional	Non-negative integer	0 (unlimited)
orientation*	optional	Vocabulary:• horizontal• vertical	vertical
shuffle	optional	boolean	false
* Deprecated in favor of the shared vocabulary.

The choice interaction is made up of choices, which use the qti-simple-choice element (SimpleChoice.Type) to present an ordered list of choices to the candidate.

As noted in the table above, the "shuffle" attribute is optional and defaults to false.  However, if the shuffle attribute is set to "true", and the delivery engine supports the discretionary "shuffle" feature, the presentation system must randomize the order in which the choices are originally listed in the Assessment Item XML, subject to the value of the fixed attribute of each choice. If fixed is "true" for a choice then the position of this choice within the interaction must not be changed by the presentation system even if the immediately enclosing interaction supports the shuffling of choices. If no value is specified then the choice is free to be shuffled.

SimpleChoice (element: qti-simple-choice) Attributes

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
identifier	required	Identifier	
template-identifier	optional	Identifier	
show-hide	optional	Vocabulary:• show• hide	show
fixed	optional	boolean	false
Here is an example of a choice interaction that allows the candidate to pick one choice (sometimes called single selection choice).

Figure 7 Expected Rendering: Choices rendered in a single column, vertically oriented.
Question with 6 response options presented vertically (each option on a new line).
By default, in the absence of any shared vocabulary, the presentation of each choice control, label, label suffix, and description, is left to the implementer, with the only requirement that the choices are displayed in a single column, vertically oriented.

The qti-choice-interaction has a considerable amount of its shared vocabulary dedicated to the presentation/layout of the interaction's associated qti-simple-choices. Each qti-simple-choice consists of a collection of elements, displayed from left to right, defined as follows:

A "control"; e.g., either a radio button or checkbox control, and
A "label"; e.g., often an alphanumeric character such as, "A", "B", "1", "2", etc.
A "label suffix"; e.g., a "." or ")" character after the label, and
A "description"; e.g., the HTML content contained by a qti-simple-choice element
Go to the 1EdTech QTI 3 Standardized Shared and CSS Classes section on Choice Interaction classes for full details.

3.2.3 Text Entry Interaction
A Text Entry Interaction is an inline interaction that obtains a simple piece of text from the candidate. Like qti-inline-choice-interaction, the delivery engine must allow the candidate to review their choice within the context of the surrounding text.

The TextEntryInteraction.Type (qti-text-entry-interaction) must be bound to a response variable with single or record cardinality only. If the response variable has single cardinality the base-type must be one of string, integer or float; if it has record cardinality the permitted fields are 'stringValue', 'floatValue', etc.

TextEntryInteraction Attributes (element: qti-text-entry-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
response-identifier	required	Identifier	
base	optional	xs:int	Default is 10.
string-identifier	optional	Identifier of a qti-response-declaration with base-type=string	
expected-length	optional	Non-negative integer	
pattern-mask	optional	string	
placeholder-text	optional	string	
format	optional	Normalized string	
Below is an example of a Text Entry Interaction:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

      And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house<br/>
      In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</p>
   </blockquote>
  </div>
 </qti-item-body>
 <qti-response-processing template="https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/qti/v3p0/rptemplates/map_response" />
</qti-assessment-item>
Which might look something like this when presented to candidates:

Figure 8 A sample text entry item as it might be presented during an assessment.
Four sentences are presented with the second sentence having a text entry box at the end of the line.
The scoring for this item could have just matched the correct response (in the response declaration) but actually uses a mapping to enable partial credit for an improperly capitalized city name (spelled without a capital letter, or all caps, or other capitilization error). When mapping strings the mapping, by default, is NOT case sensitive. This example also illustrates the use of the mapping when the response only has single cardinality.

The bulk of the shared vocabulary for the Text Entry interaction adds further definition to the presentation width of the input element by utilizing the class attribute. Go to the 1EdTech QTI 3 Standardized Shared and CSS Classes section on Text Entry Interaction classes for full details.

3.2.4 Extended Text Interaction
If an extended written response is required from the candidate then the Extended Text Interaction (qti-extended-text-interaction) is appropriate. An extended text interaction is a block Interaction that allows the candidate to enter an extended amount of text.

ExtendedTextInteraction Attributes (element: qti-extended-text-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
base	optional	xs:int	10
string-identifier	optional	Identifier of a response variable with base-type=string	
expected-length	optional	Non-negative integer	
pattern-mask	optional	xs:string	
placeholder-text	optional	xs:string	
max-strings	optional	Non-negative integer	
min-strings	optional	Non-negative integer	0 (unlimited)
expected-lines	optional	Non-negative integer	
format	optional	Vocabulary:
 • plain
 • preformatted
 • xhtml	plain
The qti-extended-text-interaction must be bound to a response variable of single, multiple, ordered or record cardinality. If the response variable has record cardinality the fields in the record must be 'stringValue', 'floatValue', etc. Otherwise it must have a base-type of string, integer or float. When bound to response variable with single cardinality a single string of text is required from the candidate. When bound to a response variable with multiple or ordered cardinality several separate text strings may be required.

The extended text interaction allows a candidate to supply a text string for a response. A basic example of the markup is shown below.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

   <qti-extended-text-interaction response-identifier="RESPONSE">
    <qti-prompt>Write Sam a postcard. Answer the questions. Write 23–30 words</qti-prompt>
   </qti-extended-text-interaction>
 </qti-item-body>
</qti-assessment-item>
Figure 9 A sample item as it might be presented during an assessment.
Writing a Postcard Illustration
The cardinality of "single" in the qti-response-processing element means that a single string of text is used in the response, though it may include multiple words or paragraphs within that string.

The example does not include a response processing node, as automated scoring of extended text responses is beyond the scope of the QTI specification.

The shared vocabulary for the extended text interaction is intended to provide more precision when describing:

Interaction height
Character counter behavior
Plain or Rich Text options
A custom pattern-mask message
Placeholder text
Responsive design implies that delivery systems should display an input area (typically, this will be a <textarea> or <div> html element) that has a width equal to 100% of the interaction's encapsulating container. Consequently, there is no shared vocabulary for overriding the width of this interaction.

Go to the 1EdTech QTI 3 Standardized Shared Vocabulary and CSS document for details related to the Extended Text Interaction.

3.2.5 Gap Match Interaction
A gap match interaction is a block Interaction that contains a number of gaps that the candidate can fill from an associated set of choices. The candidate must be able to review the content with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices.

The GapMatchInteraction.Type (qti-gap-match-interaction)  is similar to Match Interaction (qti-match-interaction) except that the choices in the second set are gaps (qti-gap) in a given passage of text and the task involves selecting choices from the first set and using them to fill the gaps. The same attributes are involved in controlling which, and how many, pairings are allowed, though there is no match-max attribute for the gaps because they can only ever have one associated choice. The scoring is again done with a mapping.

GapMatchInteration Attributes (element: qti-gap-match-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
max-associations	optional	Non-negative number	1
min-associations	optional	Non-negative number	
shuffle	optional	boolean	false
Sub-elements include qti-gap-text (GapText.Type) and qti-gap-img (GapImg.Type).

GapText Attributes (element: qti-gap-text)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
identifier	required	Identifier	
template-identifier	optional	Identifier of a template variable used to control the visibility of the qti-gap-text	
show-hide	optional	Vocabulary:• show• hide	show
match-group	optional	IdentifierList	
match-max	required	Non-negative integer	
match-min	optional	Non-negative integer	0 (unlimited)
The qti-gap-img contains a single HTML object element.

GapImg Attributes (element: qti-gap-img)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
identifier	required	Identifier	
template-identifier	optional	Identifier of a template variable used to control the visibility of the qti-gap-img	
show-hide	optional	Vocabulary:• show• hide	show
match-group	optional	IdentifierList	
match-max	required	Non-negative integer, 0 means unlimited	
match-min	optional	Non-negative integer <= match-max	0
object-label	optional	string	
top	optional	empty	
left	optional	empty	
Additional formatting may be applied within the qti-gap-text element allowing for a greater variation.' Allowed formats include:

'br', 'img', 'xi:include', 'm:math', 'object', 'qti-printed-variable', 'a', 'abbr', 'acronym', 'b', 'big', 'cite', 'code', 'dfn', 'em', 'qti-feedback-inline', 'i', 'kbd', 'q', 'samp', 'small', 'span', 'strong', 'sub', 'sup', 'tt', 'var', 'qti-template-inline', 'bdi', 'bdo', 'label', 'ruby', 'ssml11:*'.

The qti-gap-match-interaction must be bound to a response variable with base-type directedPair and either single or multiple cardinality, depending on the number of gaps. The choices represent the source of the pairing and gaps the targets. Each gap can have at most one choice associated with it. The maximum occurrence of the choices is controlled by the match-max attribute of qti-gap-text or qti-gap-img.

The following is an example of a gap match interaction:

3.2.6 Hotspot Interaction
A HotspotInteraction.Type (qti-hotspot-interaction) is a graphical interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to select one or more of the areas (hotspots).

The hotspot interaction should only be used when the spatial relationship of the choices with respect to each other (as represented by the graphic image) is important to the needs of the item. Otherwise, Choice Interaction should be used instead with separate material for each option.

The delivery engine must clearly indicate selected hotspots when such hotspots are selected.  If the Shared Vocabulary class qti-unselected-hidden is present, the delivery engine must hide the hotspots in their unselected and unfocused state.  If the qti-unselected-hidden is not present, indicating hotspots in their unselected and unfocused state is left to the delivery engine.

3.2.7 Hot Text Interaction
The HotTextInteraction.Type (qti-hottext-interaction) presents a set of choices to the candidate represented as selectable runs of text embedded within a surrounding context, such as a simple passage of text. Like Choice Interaction, the candidate's task is to select one or more of the choices, up to a maximum of max-choices.

The interaction is initialized from the qti-default-value of the associated response variable, a NULL value indicating that no choices are selected (the usual case).

HotTextInteraction Attributes (element: qti-hottext-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
min-choices	optional	Non-negative integer	0 (unlimited)
max-choices	optional	Non-negative integer	1
The qti-hottext-interaction must be bound to a response variable with a base-type of identifier and single or multiple cardinality.

The above example demonstrates an interaction with a single selection. For multiple selections, the response processing cardinality would be "multiple" and you may choose to limit the number of selections using the max-choices attribute in the qti-hottext-interaction element (or set to "0" for unlimited/all selections).

The shared vocabulary for the Hot Text Interaction is intended to provide more precision when describing:

Hiding the input control of the Hot Text choices.
Custom max|min-choices message overrides.
All information related to the Hot Text Interaction shared vocabulary is enumerated in the 1EdTech QTI 3 Standardized Shared Vocabulary and CSS document.

3.2.8 Inline Choice
The InlineChoiceInteraction.Type (qti-inline-choice-interaction) is an inline interaction to display a set of simple text choices in context in a surrounding text, which may be subject to variable value substitution with qti-printed-variable.

InlineChoiceInteraction Attributes (element: qti-inline-choice-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
identifier	required	Identifier	
required	optional	boolean	
false

If true then a choice must be selected by the candidate in order to form a valid response to the interaction.

shuffle	optional	boolean	false
The sub-element seCoolquence of qti-inline-choice-interaction is:

qti-label (maximum of 1)
qti-inline-choice (at least 1)
InlineChoice Attributes (element: qti-inline-choice)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
identifier	required	Identifier	
template-identifier	optional	Identifier of a template variable used to control the visibility of the choice	
show-hide	optional	Vocabulary:• show• hide	show
fixed	optional	boolean	false
When rendering an inline choice interaction, the common implementation is an embodiment of a <select> html form element or a combo box form control.  

Below is an example of an inline choice interaction that allows the candidate to select one answer option to respond to the prompt.

3.2.9 Match Interaction
A MatchInteraction.Type (qti-match-interaction) is a blockInteraction that presents candidates with two sets of choices and allows them to create associations between pairs of choices in the two sets, but not between pairs of choices in the same set. Further restrictions can still be placed on the allowable associations using the match-max characteristic of the choices.

The sub-element within qti-match-interaction is qti-simple-match-set.   MatchInteration Attributes (element: qti-match-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
max-associations	optional	Non-negative number	1
min-associations	optional	Non-negative number	
shuffle	optional	boolean	false
The sub-element of qti-match-interaction is qti-simple-match-set (SimpleMatchSet.Type). The qti-simple-match-set has an optional "id" attribute which contains a UniqueIdentifier.Type. The qti-simple-match-set contains an ordered set of choices using qti-simple-associable-choice (SimpleAssociableChoice.Type) elements.

SimpleAssociableChoice Attributes (element: qti-simple-associable-choice)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
identifier	required	Identifier	
template-identifier	optional	Identifier	
show-hide	optional	Vocabulary:• show• hide	show
match-group	optional	IdentifierList	
match-max	required	Non-negative integer	
match-min	optional	Non-negative integer	0 (unlimited)
fixed	optional	boolean	false
The match interaction must be bound to a response variable with base-type directedPair and either single or multiple cardinality.

In the match interaction example below, the candidate's response is declared to have directedPair because the task involves pairing up choices from a source set into a target set. In this case characters from plays with the names of the plays from which they are drawn. Notice that match-max on the characters (the first set of associable choices) is "1" because each character can be in only one play but it is "4" on the plays (the second set of associable choices) because each play could contain all the characters. For example, Demetrius and Lysander were both in A Midsummer-Night's Dream, so in the correct response that play has two associations. In the mapping used for response processing these two associations have been awarded only a half a mark each.

Go to the QTI 3 Standardized Shared Vocabulary and CSS section on Match Interaction for full details.

3.2.10 Order
In an OrderInteraction.Type (qti-order-interaction) the candidate's task is to reorder the choices, the order in which the choices are displayed initially is significant. By default the candidate's task is to order all of the choices but a subset of the choices can be requested using the max-choices and min-choices attributes. When specified the candidate must first select a (sub)set of the choices and then impose an ordering on them.

OrderInteraction Attributes (element: qti-order-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
min-choices	optional	Non-negative number	
max-choices	optional	Non-negative number	
orientation	optional	Vocabulary:• horizontal• vertical	
shuffle	optional	false	
The sub-element of qti-order-interaction is qti-simple-choice (SimpleChoice.Type) where there must be at least one qti-simple-choice in the interaction to be valid, and at least 2 choices to be useful as an order interaction.

SimpleChoice (element: qti-simple-choice) Attributes

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
identifier	required	Identifier	
template-identifier	optional	Identifier	
show-hide	optional	Vocabulary:• show• hide	show
fixed	optional	boolean	false
This example below illustrates the Order Interaction. The candidate's response is declared to have ordered and the correct value is therefore composed of an ordered list of value. The question uses the standard response processing template Match Correct to score 1 for a completely correct answer and 0 otherwise.

3.2.11 Graphic Order Interaction
A GraphicOrderInteraction.Type (qti-associate-interaction) is a graphic interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to impose an ordering on the areas (hotspots). The order hotspot interaction should only be used when the spatial relationship of the choices with respect to each other (as represented by the graphic image) is important to the needs of the item.

Otherwise, Order interaction should be used instead with separate material for each option. The delivery engine must clearly indicate all defined area(s) of the image.

Graphic Order Interaction Attributes (element: qti-graphic-order-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
max-choices	optional	Non-negative number	If unspecified, all of the choices may be ordered.
min-choices	optional	Non-negative number	If unspecified, all of the choices must be ordered and max-choices is ignored.
The sub-element sequence for the qti-graphic-order-interaction:

either img, picture, or object (must have only 1, object is deprecated)
qti-hotspot-choice (at least 1)
HotspotChoice Attributes (element: qti-hotspot-choice)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
identifier	required	Identifier	
template-identifier	optional	Identifier of a template variable used to control the visibility of the qti-hotspot-choice	
show-hide	optional	Vocabulary:• show• hide	show
shape	required	Vocabulary:• circle• default• ellipse• poly• rect	
coords	required	Coords.Type	
hotspot-label	optional	string	
The graphic order interaction must be bound to a response variable with a base-type of identifier and ordered cardinality.

3.2.13 Graphic Associate Interaction
A GraphicAssociateInteraction.Type (qti-graphic-associate-interaction) is a graphic interaction with a corresponding set of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is to associate the areas (hotspots) with each other. The graphic associate interaction should only be used when the graphical relationship of the choices with respect to each other (as represented by the graphic image) is important to the needs of the item. Otherwise, an Associate Interaction should be used instead with separate material for each option. The delivery engine must clearly indicate all defined area(s) of the image.

3.2.14 Graphic Gap Match Interaction
A GraphicGapMatchInteraction.Type (qti-graphic-gap-match-interaction) is a graphical interaction with a set of gaps that are defined as areas (hotspots) of the graphic image and an additional set of gap choices that are defined outside the image. The candidate must associate the gap choices with the gaps in the image and be able to review the image with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices.

Care should be taken when designing these interactions to ensure that the gaps in the image are a suitable size to receive the required gap choices. It must be clear to the candidate which hotspot each choice has been associated with. When associated, choices must appear wholly inside the gaps if at all possible and, where overlaps are required, should not hide each other completely. If the candidate indicates the association by positioning the choice over the gap (e.g. drag and drop) the system should 'snap' it to the nearest position that satisfies these requirements.

The graphic-gap-match-interaction must be bound to a response variable with base-type directedPair and multiple cardinality. The choices represent the source of the pairing and the gaps in the image (the hotspots) the targets. Unlike the simple GapMatchInteraction, each gap can have several choices associated with it if desired, furthermore, the same choice may be associated with an qti-associable-hotspot multiple times, in which case the corresponding directed pair appears multiple times in the value of the response variable.

Positioning of the Gap Choices container with respect to the image containing the hotspots.
Gap Choices container width.
Associable Hotspot Selections theming.

Go to the QTI 3 Standardized Shared Vocabulary and CSS section on Graphic Gap Match Interaction for full details.

3.2.15 Media
The MediaInteraction.Type (qti-media-interaction) enables measurement of the number of times the media object was experienced.  This quantity is reported in the value of the interaction's response variable.

MediaInteraction Attributes (element: qti-media-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
autostart	required	boolean	Note: Accessibility guidelines suggest that candidates should initiate any media instead of automatically playing the media, therefore the value should be "false".
min-plays	optional	Non-negative integer	0 (unlimited)
max-plays	optional	Non-negative integer	0 (unlimited)
loop	optional	boolean	false
coords	optional	Coords.Type	
The sub-elements include:

audio
video
object (deprecated)
The qti-media-interaction must be bound to a response variable of base-type integer and single cardinality.

Note that for the audio and video elements in QTI 3 markup, the "controls" attribute MUST include a value for the attribute to be valid XML. As per the HTML 5 specification, the way to exclude controls is to explicitly not include the attribute in the audio or video element. In QTI 3, valid values to include controls are "controls" (as per the HTML specification) or "true" (the more traditional boolean value for XML). So <video> would mean the controls are not provided to the candidate (as in the example below), and <video controls="controls"> would indicate the candidate should be provided with media controls.

A video preview (a still image) is shown. Text above the video area says 'Play this video.'
                      There is a larger play button in the middle of the video area.
3.2.16 Position Object Interaction
The PositionObjectInteraction.Type (qti-position-object-interaction) consists of a single image which must be positioned on another graphic image (the stage) by the candidate. Like Select Point Interaction, the associated response may have a qti-area-mapping that scores the response on the basis of comparing it against predefined areas but the delivery engine must not indicate these areas of the stage. Only the actual position(s) selected by the candidate shall be indicated.

PositionObjectInteraction Attributes (element: qti-position-object-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
center-point	optional	IntegerList	
min-choices	optional	Non-negative number	
max-choices	optional	Non-negative number	1
The sub-element for the qti-position-object-interaction is either the HTML "img" or "picture" element. The object element is deprecated in QTI 3.

The qti-position-object-interaction must be bound to a response variable with a base-type of point and single or multiple cardinality. The point records the coordinates, with respect to the stage, of the centre point of the image being positioned.

Position Object Interaction, has a required parent, the qti-position-object-stage, which is a graphic image (represented as an "object"), on top of which the Position Object Interaction image is to be positioned. A single qti-position-object-stage may have several Position Object Interactions as child elements, representing several objects to be positioned on the same "stage".

3.2.17 Select Point Interaction
The SelectPointInteraction.Type (qti-select-point-interaction) is a graphic interaction. The candidate's task is to select one or more points. The associated response may have an qti-area-mapping  that scores the response on the basis of comparing it against predefined areas but the delivery engine must not indicate these areas of the image. Only the actual point(s) selected by the candidate shall be indicated.

SelectPointInteraction Attributes (element: qti-select-point-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
min-choices	optional	Non-negative number	0
max-choices	optional	Non-negative number	0 (unlimited)
The sub-element for the qti-select-point-interaction is either the HTML "img" or "picture" element. The object element is deprecated in QTI 3.

The select point interaction must be bound to a response variable with a base-type of point and single or multiple cardinality.

3.2.18 Slider Interaction
The SliderInteraction.Type (qti-slider-interaction) presents the candidate with a control for selecting a numerical value between a lower and upper bound. It must be bound to a response variable with single cardinality with a base-type of either integer or float.

Note that a slider interaction does not have a default or initial position except where specified by a default value for  the associated response variable. The currently selected value, if any, must be clearly indicated to the candidate.

Because a slider interaction does not have a default or initial position, except where specified by a default value for the associated response variable, it is difficult to distinguish between an intentional response that corresponds to the slider's initial position and a NULL response. As a workaround, slider interaction items have to either a) not count NULL responses (i.e. count all responses as intentional) or b) include a 'skip' button and count its activation combined with a response variable that is equal to the slider's initial position as a NULL response.

There are six attributes for the qti-slider-interaction where the lower-bound and upper-bound are required attributes:

Slider Interaction Attributes (element: qti-slider-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
lower-bound	required	NonNegativeDouble

Tick marks are left entirely to the delivery platform. In the example, the interaction increases the accessibility by also allowing the candidate to input a number to move the slider and to indicate the response chosen by the candidate..
A question appears above a line. There are tick marks at regular intervals above the line.
                      In the middle of the line is a grey rectangle. Below the grey rectangle is a dark rectangle that displays the number '50'.
3.2.19 Upload
The UploadInteraction.Type (qti-upload-interaction) allows the candidate to upload a pre-prepared file representing their response.

The qti-upload-interaction must be bound to a response variable with base-type  file and single cardinality.

3.2.20 Drawing Interaction
The DrawingInteraction.Type (qti-drawing-interaction) allows the candidate to use a set of drawing tools to modify a given graphical image (the canvas).  It must be bound to a response variable with base type file and single cardinality.

DrawingInteraction Attributes (element: qti-drawing-interaction)

Name	Usage	Value(s)	Default
class	optional	xs:string	
response-identifier	mandatory	identifier	
The sub-element of the qti-drawing-interaction are the HTML elements img, picture, or object. The image specified within one of the aforementioned elements acts as the canvas on which the drawing takes place. It is best practice to use the img or picture elements for this interaction. If using the deprecated object element it MUST be of an image type, as specified by the type attribute.

3.2.21 End Attempt Interaction
End Attempt Interaction is a special interaction which immediately ends the current attempt on an assessment item.  It may be used, for example, to allow the candidate to request a hint or model solution, or in an adaptive item to let the candidate display feedback or to move to the next in a series of interactions in the item.

                      Below the button is a sentence of text (the hint).
3.2.22 Custom Interaction
The CustomInteraction.Type (qti-custom-interaction) is a deprecated feature in QTI 3. It is recommended to use Portable Custom Interaction (next section) in place of the custom interaction. The Custom Interaction provides an opportunity for delivery platform-specific extensibility of this specification to include support for interactions not currently built into the QTI specification.  This can be used, for example, to develop technology-enhanced items.

As the user interface and behavior of a qti-custom-interaction are custom, there is no predefined shared vocabulary for qti-custom-interaction.  However if a qti-custom-interaction implements a feature or behavior in a way which is consistent with how that has been defined for the pre-defined interaction types then it may use qti- prefixed class names to indicate it supports a behaviour consistent with the use of that shared vocabulary elsewhere in this specification; e.g., a qti-custom-interaction which supports text entry by the candidate may support the qti-input-width set of classes to control the visible width allocated to display of the candidate's input.

                      There are 3 buttons below the circle: Fewer, More, Reset.
3.2.23 Portable Custom Interaction (PCI)
The PortableCustomInteraction.Type (qti-portable-custom-interaction) allows an item author with the support of a PCI module developer the ability to render an interaction with a custom user interface and behaviors by providing custom Javascript code supporting the interaction. This can be used, for example, to develop technology-enhanced items.

The Javascript code which implements a PCI may be included with the item in the content package or may reside elsewhere on the network. It will be loaded dynamically by the delivery engine when the item containing the PCI is presented.  These Javascript modules must be AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) modules, and must conform to the PCI API, detailed later in this document.   The markup of a PCI may include any HTML5, MathML, and SSML elements supported elsewhere in QTI.  In addition, a PCI may contain feedback, template, and printed variable elements.  Finally, a special templateelement may be included. This may be used only in a PCI and is a container for any valid XML markup.

As the user interface and behavior of a PCI are custom, there is no predefined shared vocabulary for PCIs.  However if a PCI implements a feature or behavior in a way which is consistent with how that has been defined for the pre-defined interaction types then it MAY use qti- prefixed CSS class names to indicate it supports a behaviour consistent with the use of that shared vocabulary elsewhere in this specification; e.g. a PCI which supports text entry by the candidate may support the qti-input-width set of classes to control the visible width allocated to display of the candidate's input.

PCI allows for referencing a stylesheet using the qti-stylesheet element, where the stylesheet is specific to the code referenced within the PCI. PCI also allows for the inclusion of catalog information that is specific to the PCI. PCI is the only interaction that allows for these elements within the interaction. All other interactions would use the item level stylesheet reference and the item level catalog node.

There is a detailed example of a PCI in Section 3.7.12 .  Consequently, example definitions and expected renderings are not provided here.
